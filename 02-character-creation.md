# Character Creation

> **Status:** Stub — to be developed.

## Scope

This section will cover the step-by-step character creation process, adapted from PF2e Player Core Chapter 1.

## Areas to Develop

### Creation Steps

Port and adapt PF2e's character creation walkthrough:

1. Choose ancestry, heritage, and ancestry feat (see [Ancestries](03-ancestries.md))
1. Choose background (see [Backgrounds](04-backgrounds.md))
1. Choose class and subclass (see [Classes](05-classes.md))
1. Determine ability scores
1. Record class details (HP, proficiencies, class features)
1. Buy equipment (see [Equipment](09-equipment.md))
1. Calculate modifiers

### Ability Scores

PF2e Remastered uses a boost/flaw system with two free ancestry boosts. This system uses **Gradual Ability Boosts** as standard (see [Core Rules](01-core-rules.md)), spreading level 5 and 10 boosts across intermediate levels.

Determine how to present the boost system clearly for new players. Consider whether a simplified point-buy or array alternative is worth offering alongside the boost system.

### Starting Equipment

Define starting gold and/or equipment packages by class. Reference PF2e's class kits as a starting point.

## Design Considerations

- Character creation is the first interaction new players have with the system — clarity and speed matter more here than anywhere else.
- Consider a "quick start" path (pick from prebuilt packages) alongside a full customization path.
- Ancestry → Background → Class ordering mirrors PF2e and works well narratively ("who you are → where you came from → what you do").
