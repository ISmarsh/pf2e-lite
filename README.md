## Supporting Files

- `pf2e_mana_math.xlsx` — Mana system mathematical analysis (cost curves, pool sizing, flexibility scenarios)

## Key Design Decisions

- **Levels 1–10, Master cap** — Adventurer tier only
- **Mana replaces Vancian** — Moderate cost curve (1/2/4/7/11), long rest recovery only, full-caster-only
- **20 conditions** — Down from 40+, two-tier detection
- **Three-box dying** — Visual checkboxes, baked-in wounded escalation
- **Simplified shields** — Block value + durability ticks
- **Three feat tracks** — Class / General (merged skill+general) / Ancestry + proficiency auto-unlocks
- **16 skills unchanged**
- **11 classes** — 3 martial + 4 full caster + 4 empowered (one per tradition pair)
- **Empowered classes** — Tradition-flavored martial/skill classes with focus spells, no mana pool (Champion, Ranger, Artificer, Thaumaturge)
- **Artificer** — INT arcane-empowered crafter, Alchemist-model infusion system, 4 subclasses
- **Thaumaturge** — CHA occult-empowered martial, Exploit Vulnerability + Implements, ported from Dark Archive
- **7 ancestries, 43 heritages** — All ported from PF2e Remastered
- **Crafting redesigned** — 25% material cost, 1–3 day crafting time by proficiency
- **Free Archetype + Gradual Ability Boosts** — Standard rules
- **All multiclass dedications defined** — Three templates (martial/empowered/full caster)
