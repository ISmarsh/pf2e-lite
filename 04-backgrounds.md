# Backgrounds

> **Status:** Stub — to be developed.

## Scope

Backgrounds provide two ability boosts, training in a skill and a Lore subcategory, and a skill feat. They represent a character's life before adventuring.

## Areas to Develop

### Core Background List

Port a curated set of PF2e backgrounds that are setting-neutral. PF2e has 50+ backgrounds; select 15–20 that cover common character archetypes:

- **Combat-adjacent:** Soldier, Guard, Gladiator, Hunter, Sailor
- **Knowledge-adjacent:** Scholar, Acolyte, Herbalist, Tinker
- **Social-adjacent:** Entertainer, Merchant, Noble, Criminal, Charlatan
- **Wilderness-adjacent:** Farmhand, Nomad, Scout, Hermit

Golarion-specific backgrounds (Pathfinder Hopeful, Chelish Rebel, etc.) must be replaced with setting-neutral equivalents.

### Mechanical Framework

Port directly from PF2e:

- Two ability boosts (one fixed from a choice of two, one free)
- Trained in one skill
- Trained in one Lore subcategory
- One skill feat (must be available at level 1)

### Integration with Character Creation

Backgrounds slot between ancestry and class selection (see [Character Creation](02-character-creation.md)). They should be quick to choose and immediately evocative.

## Design Considerations

- Keep the list short enough that new players aren't overwhelmed but broad enough to cover most character concepts.
- Lore subcategories add flavor at zero mechanical cost — lean into this.
- Avoid backgrounds that grant combat-relevant abilities beyond a skill feat; save those choices for class and ancestry.
