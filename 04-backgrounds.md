# Backgrounds

Backgrounds represent a character's life before adventuring. Each background provides two ability boosts, training in a skill and a Lore subcategory, and a skill feat. All mechanics ported directly from PF2e Remastered under ORC.

Backgrounds slot between ancestry and class selection during character creation (see [Character Creation](02-character-creation.md)). They should be quick to choose and immediately evocative.

## Mechanical Framework

Every background grants:

- **Two ability boosts** — one fixed (choice of two attributes), one free
- **Trained** in one skill
- **Trained** in one Lore subcategory
- **One skill feat** (must be available at level 1)

## Common Backgrounds (56)

All common backgrounds are setting-neutral and available to any character.

## Rare Backgrounds (8)

Rare backgrounds have special mechanics beyond the standard framework. Require GM approval.

### Amnesiac

- **Boosts:** Three free (you choose 2, GM chooses 1 based on hidden history)
- **Skill/Lore/Feat:** GM determines based on forgotten past
- **Special:** You and the GM work out details of your forgotten identity. You get initial clues.

### Blessed

- **Boosts:** WIS/CHA, Free
- **Skill:** —
- **Lore:** Deity (the blessing deity)
- **Feat:** —
- **Special:** Cast *guidance* as a divine innate cantrip at will, or GM-determined blessing.

### Cursed

- **Boosts:** INT/CHA, Free
- **Skill:** Occultism
- **Lore:** Curse
- **Special:** **Warding Sign** reaction (concentrate; 1/minute) — trigger: you attempt a saving throw against a magical effect but haven't rolled yet. +2 circumstance bonus to the save (+3 if a curse). GM determines curse manifestations.

### Feral Child

- **Boosts:** STR, DEX, or CON (one boost only — no free boost)
- **Skills:** Nature and Survival (two skills instead of one)
- **Lore:** —
- **Feat:** Forager
- **Special:** Low-light vision (or darkvision if you already had low-light vision). Imprecise scent 30 ft.

### Feybound

- **Boosts:** DEX/CHA, Free
- **Skill:** —
- **Lore:** Fey
- **Feat:** —
- **Special:** **Fey's Fortune** free action (concentrate, fortune; 1/day) — trigger: you attempt a skill check and haven't yet rolled. Roll twice, take better result. Anathema: must fulfill a single request from any fey who knows your name. Violating suspends Fey's Fortune until atonement via Nature.

### Haunted

- **Boosts:** WIS/CHA, Free
- **Skill:** Occultism + GM-determined additional skill (the entity's specialty)
- **Special:** GM can offer +1 circumstance bonus on the entity's skill (as Aid). If you accept but fail: frightened 2 (frightened 4 on critical failure). This initial frightened cannot be reduced.

### Returned

- **Boosts:** CON/WIS, Free
- **Lore:** Boneyard (via Additional Lore feat)
- **Special:** Gain the Diehard feat and the Additional Lore feat (Boneyard Lore).

### Royalty

- **Boosts:** INT/CHA, Free
- **Skill:** Society
- **Feat:** Courtly Graces
- **Special:** Influence commoners in family territory and nobility anywhere. If you later gain Leverage Connections, you automatically have common and noble connections in your territory and noble connections in large communities elsewhere.

## Design Notes

- **All 56 common backgrounds ported.** Every remastered background is already setting-neutral. The original plan to curate 15–20 was unnecessary — none reference Golarion-specific content.
- **Lore subcategories** with player-chosen topics (Terrain, City, etc.) add flavor at zero mechanical cost.
- **Raised by Belief** references deities — use with setting-appropriate pantheon.
- **Rare backgrounds** should be offered sparingly. Amnesiac, Haunted, and Feybound require significant GM investment. Blessed and Returned grant mechanical benefits (innate cantrip, Diehard) that other backgrounds don't.
