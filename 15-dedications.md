# Dedications

## Overview

Multiclass dedications allow any character to gain basic features of another class by spending class feats (or Free Archetype feats, since Free Archetype is standard). Ported from PF2e with mana conversion for caster dedications.

**Restriction (per PF2e):** Can't take a new Dedication until you've taken at least two other feats from your current archetype. Prevents cherry-picking.

## Three Dedication Templates

### Full Caster Dedications (Wizard, Cleric, Druid, Bard)

- **Dedication feat (level 2):** Cantrips + trained in tradition's spell attacks/DCs + class-specific minor feature
- **Basic Spellcasting (level 4):** Mana progression (quarter caster, see [Spellcasting](10-spellcasting.md))
- **Basic Class Feat (level 4):** Pick a class feat of half your level or lower
- **Advanced Class Feat (level 6):** Pick a class feat of your level or lower

### Empowered Dedications (Champion, Ranger, Artificer, Thaumaturge)

- **Dedication feat (level 2):** Signature mechanic + skill training
- **Basic Class Feat (level 4):** Pick a class feat of half your level or lower
- **Advanced Class Feat (level 6):** Pick a class feat of your level or lower
- **Signature Mechanic Expansion (level 8):** Deepens the signature feature
- **No mana path** — empowered classes don't grant spellcasting through dedications

Key difference from full caster dedications: the dedication feat grants the signature mechanic instead of cantrips. No Basic Spellcasting option.

### Martial Dedications (Fighter, Rogue, Barbarian)

- **Dedication feat (level 2):** Weapon/armor training + reduced signature feature
- **Basic Class Feat (level 4):** Pick a class feat of half your level or lower
- **Advanced Class Feat (level 6):** Pick a class feat of your level or lower
- **No spellcasting path**

### Empowered Dedication vs Full Class (Artificer Example)

| Feature | Full Artificer | Dedication |

| Tamper | Full progression (Expert@3, Master@7 Crafting) | Basic only (Trained Crafting) |
| Subclass production | INT mod items/slots (4 at INT +4) + subclass features | 2 items from one chosen type (L8+), item DC only |
| Formulas known | Extensive, grows each level | 4 common formulas |
| Subclass | Yes (L1 choice) | No (limited L8 access) |
| Focus spells | Via feat investment | Via Basic/Advanced Class Feat |
| Crafting auto-scaling | Expert@3, Master@7 | Just trained |

## Eldritch Trickster Resolution

Rogue's Eldritch Trickster racket grants a free **full caster** multiclass dedication at level 1. Player chooses Wizard, Cleric, Druid, or Bard — gaining cantrips and eventual mana access through Basic Spellcasting.

## Generic Archetypes

Non-multiclass archetypes (Medic, Marshal, Sentinel, Eldritch Archer, Blessed One, etc.) are deferred to expansion. Each is a self-contained feat chain that can be added later without changing core rules.

High-priority candidates for first expansion: Medic, Marshal, Sentinel (most popular at tables).

## Open Design Work

- Verify all dedication features against our system changes (mana, conditions, etc.)
- Review PF2e's full archetype list and flag candidates for expansion
- Determine which generic archetypes are essential vs. nice-to-have
