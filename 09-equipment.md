# Equipment

> **Status:** Stub — to be developed.

## Scope

This section will cover weapons, armor, adventuring gear, materials, and pricing, ported from PF2e Remastered with adjustments for our simplified systems.

## Areas to Develop

### Weapons

Port PF2e's weapon tables for levels 1–10. Key considerations:

- Simple, martial, and advanced weapon categories
- Weapon traits (the trait system is one of PF2e's strengths — port directly)
- Weapon groups and critical specialization effects
- Pricing against our revised crafting economics (see [Crafting](14-crafting.md))

### Armor

Port PF2e's armor tables. Key considerations:

- Light, medium, and heavy armor categories
- Armor traits (comfort, noisy, bulwark, etc.)
- AC bonuses, Dexterity caps, check penalties, speed penalties
- Shield stats integrated with our simplified shield system (see [Shields](13-shields.md))

### Adventuring Gear

Port standard adventuring gear. Most is flavor/utility with no system interaction concerns.

### Materials

Define material progression for weapons, armor, and shields:

- Standard materials (wood, steel)
- Precious materials (cold iron, silver, adamantine, etc.)
- Material-based damage type interactions (cold iron vs fey, silver vs fiends)
- Pricing and level requirements

### Runes

Port PF2e's rune system:

- Fundamental runes (potency, striking, resilient)
- Property runes (flaming, frost, etc.)
- Interaction with Artificer infusions (see [Artificer](06-artificer.md)) — infusions occupy a separate "space" from permanent runes

### Pricing and Economy

Verify all item pricing against:

- Our crafting economics (25% material cost, see [Crafting](14-crafting.md))
- Expected wealth by level (PF2e treasure tables)
- Consumable batch pricing (4 items per crafting check)

## Design Considerations

- Equipment tables are mostly a straight port — the weapon/armor math is part of PF2e's core balance.
- Shield stats need to use our simplified system (Block Value + Durability Ticks instead of Hardness/HP/BT).
- Material progression matters for the level 1–10 range. Verify which special materials are available and at what levels.
- Rune interaction with Artificer infusions needs clear documentation to avoid confusion.
