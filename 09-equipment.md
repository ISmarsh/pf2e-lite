### Handwraps of Mighty Blows

| Item | Level | Price | Bulk |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Handwraps of Mighty Blows | 2 | 5 gp | — |

Worn on hands. Transfer weapon fundamental runes (potency, striking) and property runes to all unarmed attacks. Etch runes onto handwraps using the same rune costs and levels as weapons — a Monk with +1 Striking handwraps deals 2d6 with fists at the same cost as a Fighter's +1 Striking longsword.

Essential for unarmed-focused characters (primarily Monk). Without handwraps, unarmed attacks can't benefit from item bonuses to attack rolls or extra damage dice from striking runes.

### Ammunition

| Type | Price (per 10) | Bulk |
|------|----------------|------|
| Arrows | 1 sp | L |
| Bolts | 1 sp | L |
| Blowgun Darts | 5 cp | L |
| Sling Bullets | 1 cp | L |

|-------|--------|
| Agile | -4 MAP instead of -5 on 2nd attack, -8 instead of -10 on 3rd |
| Backstabber | +1 precision damage against off-guard targets |
| Deadly dX | Extra damage dice on critical hit |
| Fatal dX | Damage die changes to dX on critical hit, +1 dX |
| Finesse | Use DEX instead of STR for attack rolls |
| Forceful | Bonus damage on consecutive hits (= weapon dice on 2nd, ×2 on 3rd+) |
| Monk | Can use with flurry of blows |
| Propulsive | Add half STR to damage |
| Reach | 10 ft reach instead of 5 ft |
| Sweep | +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against 2nd+ target this turn |
| Trip | Can use weapon for Trip attempts |
| Two-Hand dX | Damage die changes when wielded in two hands |
| Versatile X | Can deal alternate damage type |

**Bulwark:** Use +3 modifier for Reflex saves if your DEX modifier is +0 or +1.

### Armor Specialization Effects

| Group | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Chain | Resistances to slashing damage |
| Cloth | +1 circumstance bonus to a saving throw |
| Composite | Reduce physical damage by 1 |

## Shields

Uses simplified Block Value + Durability Ticks system (see [Shields](13-shields.md) for full mechanics).

### Base Shields

| Shield | AC | Block Value | Durability | Price | Bulk |
|--------|-----|-------------|------------|-------|------|
| Buckler | +1 | 3 | 2 | 1 gp | L |
| Wooden Shield | +2 | 3 | 2 | 1 gp | 1 |
| Steel Shield | +2 | 5 | 3 | 2 gp | 1 |
| Tower Shield | +2 (+4 Take Cover) | 5 | 3 | 10 gp | 4 |

> **Tower Shield:** Takes an action to set in place (Take Cover), granting +4 AC instead of +2. -5 ft speed penalty while wielding.

### Sturdy Shields

Upgraded shields with progressively better defenses. Available as loot or purchases.

| Shield | Level | Block Value | Durability | Price |
|--------|-------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Sturdy Shield (Minor) | 4 | 8 | 6 | 100 gp |
| Sturdy Shield (Lesser) | 7 | 10 | 7 | 360 gp |
| Sturdy Shield (Moderate) | 10 | 13 | 8 | 1,000 gp |

> Block Value and Durability derived from PF2e's Hardness/HP/BT. See [Conversion Formula](13-shields.md#conversion-formula) for the conversion formula and rationale.

### Material Shields

Precious material shields available in the L1-10 range:

| Material | Grade | Level | Block | Ticks | Price | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Cold Iron | Low | 2 | Base | Base | 30-34 gp | Effective against fey, demons |
| Silver | Low | 2 | Base | Base | 30-34 gp | Effective against devils, werewolves |
| Cold Iron | Standard | 7 | Base | Base | 300-340 gp | |
| Silver | Standard | 7 | Base | Base | 300-340 gp | |
| Adamantine | Standard | 8 | Base | Base +1 | 400-440 gp | Hardest common metal |
| Dawnsilver | Standard | 8 | Base | Base +1 | 400-440 gp | Silver properties, 1 Bulk lighter |
| Duskwood | Standard | 8 | Base | Base +1 | 400-560 gp | 1 Bulk lighter (wood only) |

> "Base" = the Block Value and Durability of the underlying shield type. Special materials (Adamantine, Dawnsilver, Duskwood) gain +1 Tick for superior construction. Price range reflects buckler vs shield vs tower shield variants. See [Shields](13-shields.md) for full material progression.

## Runes

### Fundamental Runes

Fundamental runes provide the core numerical progression for weapons and armor.

#### Weapon Runes

| Rune | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Weapon Potency +1 | 2 | 35 gp | +1 item bonus to attack rolls. 1 property rune slot. |
| Striking | 4 | 65 gp | Weapon deals 2 damage dice instead of 1. |
| Weapon Potency +2 | 10 | 935 gp | +2 item bonus to attack rolls. 2 property rune slots. |

> Greater Striking (L12, 3 dice) and +3 Potency (L16) are above our level range.

#### Armor Runes

| Rune | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Armor Potency +1 | 5 | 160 gp | +1 item bonus to AC. 1 property rune slot. |
| Resilient | 8 | 340 gp | +1 item bonus to saving throws. |
| Armor Potency +2 | 11 | 1,060 gp | +2 item bonus to AC. 2 property rune slots. |

> Armor Potency +2 is level 11 — just outside our range. Characters will typically cap at +1 Resilient armor. Greater Resilient (L14) is well above range.

#### Shield Rune

| Rune | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Reinforcing (Minor) | 4 | 75 gp | +2 Block Value, +2 Durability |
| Reinforcing (Lesser) | 7 | 300 gp | +3 Block Value, +3 Durability |
| Reinforcing (Moderate) | 10 | 900 gp | +4 Block Value, +4 Durability |

> Reinforcing runes stack with shield base stats and material bonuses. A reinforced shield trails a Sturdy shield at the same level — Sturdy is the dedicated Shield Block option, Reinforcing keeps special-ability shields viable for occasional blocking. See [Shields](13-shields.md) for comparison table.

### Weapon Property Runes (Level 1-10)

### Material Weapon/Armor Pricing

Material items cost more than base items. For weapons:

| Material | Grade | Weapon Level | Weapon Price |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Cold Iron / Silver | Low | 2 | 40 gp + 4 gp/Bulk |
| Cold Iron / Silver | Standard | 10 | 880 gp + 88 gp/Bulk |
| Adamantine / Dawnsilver / Duskwood | Standard | 11 | 1,400 gp + 140 gp/Bulk |

For armor:

| Material | Grade | Armor Level | Armor Price |
|----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Cold Iron / Silver | Low | 5 | 140 gp + 14 gp/Bulk |
| Cold Iron / Silver | Standard | 11 | 1,200 gp + 120 gp/Bulk |
| Adamantine / Dawnsilver / Duskwood / Dragonhide | Standard | 12 | 1,600 gp + 160 gp/Bulk |

> Standard-grade material weapons (L10-11) and armor (L11-12) are at the edge of our level range. Low-grade cold iron and silver weapons (L2) are the primary material interaction at early levels.

### Material Damage Interactions

| Material | Effective Against | How It Works |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Cold Iron | Fey, demons | Creatures with cold iron weakness take extra damage |
| Silver | Devils, werewolves | Bypasses some resistances, creatures with silver weakness take extra damage |
| Adamantine | Hard objects | Objects treated as half Hardness when struck |
| Dawnsilver | Same as silver | Counts as silver for damage purposes + lighter |
| Dragonhide | Varies by dragon | Armor immune to one damage type (Arcane→Force, Divine→Spirit, Occult→Mental, Primal→Poison) |

Per PF2e GM Core treasure tables. Use these to calibrate loot and shop availability.

| Level | Permanent Items | Currency | Total Approximate Value |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------------------|
| 1 | — | 15 gp | 15 gp |
| 2 | 1x L2 | 20 gp | 55 gp |
| 3 | 1x L3, 1x L2 | 25 gp | 120 gp |
| 4 | 1x L4, 2x L3 | 30 gp | 225 gp |
| 5 | 1x L5, 2x L4 | 50 gp | 425 gp |
| 6 | 1x L6, 2x L5 | 80 gp | 750 gp |
| 7 | 1x L7, 2x L6 | 125 gp | 1,250 gp |
| 8 | 1x L8, 2x L7 | 180 gp | 2,000 gp |
| 9 | 1x L9, 2x L8 | 250 gp | 3,100 gp |
| 10 | 1x L10, 2x L9 | 350 gp | 4,800 gp |

> Values are cumulative per character. Actual loot distribution depends on party size and campaign pacing.

### Crafting Economics

Per our crafting system (see [Crafting](14-crafting.md)):
- Material cost: 25% of item price
- Formula cost: ~10-15% of item price
- First craft total: ~35-40% of item price
- Subsequent crafts: 25% of item price

### Equipment Progression Benchmarks

Typical upgrade path for a martial character:

| Level | Weapon | Armor | Shield |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Base weapon | Starting armor | Base shield |
| 2 | +1 Weapon Potency (35 gp) | — | Low-grade material (optional) |
| 4 | +1 Striking (100 gp total) | — | Sturdy Minor (100 gp) |
| 5 | — | +1 Armor Potency (160 gp) | — |
| 7 | — | — | Sturdy Lesser (360 gp) |
| 8 | First property rune (500 gp) | Resilient (500 gp total) | — |
| 10 | +2 Striking (1,000 gp total) | — | Sturdy Moderate (1,000 gp) |

## Interaction with Artificer Infusions

Artificer infusions (see [Artificer](06-artificer.md)) occupy a separate "space" from permanent runes. A weapon can have both its normal runes **and** an active infusion without conflict. Most infusions provide qualitative capabilities (like a damage type or a utility effect), not numerical bonuses. Exception: the Enchanter subclass can create temporary fundamental runes, but standard rune restrictions prevent stacking with existing ones.

## Design Notes

- **Weapon and armor tables are straight ports** — the math is PF2e's core balance. No modifications needed.
- **Shield stats use the simplified system** from [Shields](13-shields.md). Block Value = PF2e Hardness (1:1), Durability Ticks derived from expected Shield Blocks at-level. See 13-shields.md for full conversion formula.
- **Runes capped at L10** — only fundamental runes and property runes available in our range are listed. Greater/Major tiers exist in PF2e but are beyond our scope.
- **Armor Potency +2 (L11)** is technically out of range — characters will cap at +1 Armor Potency + Resilient. This is a natural power ceiling for the system.
- **Material progression matters** — cold iron and silver weapons are affordable by L2 and relevant for creature vulnerabilities. Standard-grade special materials (L8) are late-game upgrades.
- **Adventuring gear** is mostly a straight port. Level 3 upgraded toolkits are the main mechanical interaction (+1 item bonuses).
