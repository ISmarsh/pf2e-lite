# Exploration & Downtime

> **Status:** Stub — to be developed.

## Scope

This section will cover exploration mode, travel, resting, and downtime activities, adapted from PF2e Player Core Chapter 8 and GM Core.

## Areas to Develop

### Exploration Mode

Port PF2e's exploration mode framework:

- **Exploration activities:** Avoid Notice, Defend, Detect Magic, Hustle, Investigate, Scout, Search, etc.
- How exploration activities interact with our simplified conditions (especially the two-tier detection system, see [Conditions](11-conditions.md))
- Travel pace and overland movement

### Resting

Define rest mechanics:

- **10-minute rest:** Refocus (recover focus points), Repair items, Treat Wounds, Field Crafting (see [Crafting](14-crafting.md))
- **Long rest (daily preparation):** Full HP recovery, mana pool recovery (see [Spellcasting](10-spellcasting.md)), Artificer infusion prep (see [Artificer](06-artificer.md)), reset knockdown count (see [Dying](12-dying.md))

### Downtime Activities

Port and evaluate PF2e's downtime activities:

- **Crafting** — already redesigned (see [Crafting](14-crafting.md))
- **Earn Income** — port directly (note: no longer interacts with crafting)
- **Retrain** — port directly
- **Learn a Spell** — port directly (interacts with mana system)
- **Research** — evaluate for simplification
- **Subsist** — port directly

### Hero Points

Determine whether to port PF2e's Hero Point system as-is or simplify. Hero Points provide a narrative safety valve (spend to stabilize or reroll). Consider interaction with our three-box dying system.

## Design Considerations

- Exploration mode is one of PF2e's underused features — many groups default to "I walk around." Consider whether simplified exploration activities would see more use.
- Downtime is where crafting lives, so this section must reference the crafting system clearly.
- The Gadgeteer Artificer subclass is designed around battlefield control and deployed devices — ensure exploration activities give that subclass room to shine (e.g., deploying gadgets as scouts, alarms, or environmental tools).
