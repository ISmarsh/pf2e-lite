# PF2e Lite — Spell Modifications
#
# Primary change: all spells use mana costs instead of spell slots.
# Cost is determined by rank: { 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 7, 5: 11 }
# Cantrips (rank 0) are free and auto-heighten.
#
# See docs/10-spellcasting.md and docs/10a-spell-audit.md for full details.

# Global transformation applied to all spells by compile-data.mjs:
global:
  add_field:
    mana_cost:
      source: level
      mapping:
        0: 0    # Cantrips are free
        1: 1
        2: 2
        3: 4
        4: 7
        5: 11

remove: []
  # No spells are removed outright in the core set.
  # The spell audit (docs/10a-spell-audit.md) identifies spells that
  # reference Golarion-specific content but recommends rephrasing, not removal.

modify: []
  # Individual spell modifications TBD based on spell audit.
  # Most changes are systemic (mana costs) handled by the global transform above.

add: []
  # No custom spells in core. Artificer Arcwright focus spells are
  # class features, not tradition spells.
