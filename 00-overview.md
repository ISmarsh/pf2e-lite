# Overview

## Vision

A streamlined derivative of Pathfinder 2e Remastered, designed to lower the barrier to entry while preserving the tactical depth and tight math that make PF2e great. Targets levels 1–10 (Adventurer tier), where PF2e's design shines brightest.

## Design Principles

- **Preserve core math.** The ±10 crit threshold, 65% base hit rate, and degrees of success remain exactly as PF2e.
- **Preserve core action economy.** Three-action economy is unchanged.
- **Simplify systems, not depth.** Reduce subsystems and conditions without removing tactical decisions.
- **Reward investment.** Character build choices should feel meaningfully rewarded.
- **Port where possible.** Use PF2e Remastered mechanics directly under ORC; only redesign what needs improvement.

## Scope

- Levels 1–10 only
- Proficiency cap: Master (no Legendary)
- Four spell traditions: Arcane, Divine, Primal, Occult
- 11 classes, 7 ancestries, 16 skills
- Streamlined conditions, dying, shields, feats, and crafting
- Free Archetype and Gradual Ability Boosts as standard rules

## Licensing — ORC

Released under the **ORC License (Open RPG Creative License)**.

**Licensed Material (can use):**

- Game mechanics: statblocks, rules, character attributes, systems
- Spell mechanics: range, area, numerical effects, mechanical descriptions
- Class mechanics: proficiency progressions, HP, feat lists, class features
- The license explicitly permits use "in connection with printed books, video games, podcasts, AI, or any other technology"

**Reserved Material (cannot use):**

- Trademarks (Pathfinder, Golarion, etc.)
- World lore, story arcs, distinctive characters (named NPCs, deities)
- Visual art
- Named deities, specific locations, setting-specific history

**Practical implications:**

- All PF2e mechanical systems are available (classes, ancestries, feats, spells, conditions, etc.)
- Golarion lore, named deities, and Paizo IP characters must be replaced
- All flavor text must be original human-written content
- Generic fantasy vocabulary (Fighter, Dwarf, etc.) is fine
- Spells named after Golarion characters need renaming

## AI Policy

AI is used as a design partner only — mechanics, brainstorming, math analysis. All prose, flavor text, and art must be human-created. This aligns with community expectations around AI use in TTRPG products.

**Paizo's AI policy** bans AI-generated content in their own products and on the Pathfinder Infinite marketplace. This does not restrict independent ORC-licensed projects, but community sentiment is strongly anti-AI-generated content. Transparent framing matters: "AI-assisted design," not "AI-generated product."
