# Skills

## Overview

All 16 PF2e skills preserved unchanged. Nothing is redundant enough to justify merging, and every cut would hurt some class or playstyle disproportionately.

## The 16 Skills

## Design Notes

- The four knowledge skills (Arcana, Nature, Occultism, Religion) each tie to a spell tradition, which matters for Recall Knowledge checks and identifying spells. This mechanical linkage justifies keeping them separate.
- Lore subcategories add character flavor at zero mechanical cost. Keep as-is.
- Performance exists primarily for Bard class identity. Cutting it would disproportionately harm that class.
- Presentation improvement (grouping by category in a character builder app) is a UI decision, not a mechanical one.
