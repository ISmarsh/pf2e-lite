# Skills

## Overview

All 16 PF2e skills preserved unchanged. Nothing is redundant enough to justify merging, and every cut would hurt some class or playstyle disproportionately.

## The 16 Skills

| Skill | Category | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Acrobatics | Physical | Balance, tumble, escape |
| Arcana | Knowledge | Arcane magic, arcane creatures |
| Athletics | Physical | Climb, swim, grapple, shove, trip |
| Crafting | Technical | Repair, create items (see [Crafting](14-crafting.md)) |
| Deception | Social | Lie, feint, disguise |
| Diplomacy | Social | Persuade, gather information, make an impression |
| Intimidation | Social | Demoralize, coerce |
| Lore | Knowledge | Wildcard subcategory (Lore: Cooking, Lore: Sailing, etc.) |
| Medicine | Technical | Treat wounds, first aid, treat disease |
| Nature | Knowledge | Primal magic, natural creatures, Command an Animal |
| Occultism | Knowledge | Occult magic, occult creatures |
| Performance | Social | Perform for an audience (Bard's primary skill) |
| Religion | Knowledge | Divine magic, divine creatures, undead |
| Society | Knowledge | Law, government, culture, deciphering text |
| Stealth | Physical | Sneak, hide, avoid detection |
| Thievery | Technical | Pick locks, pick pockets, disable devices |

## Proficiency Benefits

Some skills grant additional benefits at higher proficiency ranks beyond the improved check bonus. These replace PF2e skill feats that were effectively mandatory — experienced players universally took them, making them feat taxes rather than real choices.

### Medicine

| Proficiency | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Trained | Treat Wounds (base action) |
| Expert | Treat Wounds immunity reduced to 10 minutes (instead of 1 hour) |
| Master | Treat Wounds and Treat Disease can target up to 4 creatures simultaneously |

This replaces Continual Recovery and Ward Medic from PF2e. Battle Medicine remains a general feat — it grants a fundamentally different action (single-action combat healing) rather than scaling an existing one, making it a genuine build choice.

## Design Notes

- The four knowledge skills (Arcana, Nature, Occultism, Religion) each tie to a spell tradition, which matters for Recall Knowledge checks and identifying spells. This mechanical linkage justifies keeping them separate.
- Lore subcategories add character flavor at zero mechanical cost. Keep as-is.
- Performance exists primarily for Bard class identity. Cutting it would disproportionately harm that class.
- Presentation improvement (grouping by category in a character builder app) is a UI decision, not a mechanical one.
