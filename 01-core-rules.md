# Core Rules

## Level Range and Proficiency

- **Levels 1–10** (Adventurer tier). This is where PF2e's math is tightest and the system performs best.
- **Maximum proficiency rank: Master.** No Legendary proficiency at this tier.
- Preserves tight math: 65% base hit rate, ±10 crit threshold.

## Action Economy

Three-action economy preserved exactly as PF2e:

- Three actions per turn
- One reaction per round
- Free actions as applicable

No changes.

## Degrees of Success

Preserved exactly as PF2e:

- **Critical Success:** Beat DC by 10+
- **Success:** Meet or beat DC
- **Failure:** Below DC
- **Critical Failure:** Below DC by 10+
- Natural 20 upgrades one step, natural 1 downgrades one step.

No changes.

## Standard Variant Rules

The following PF2e optional rules are **standard** in this system:

### Gradual Ability Boosts

Ability boosts from levels 5 and 10 are spread across intermediate levels for smoother power progression, avoiding large spike levels. Better experience for newer players who might not realize the impact of a four-boost level.

### Free Archetype

At every even level, characters gain an additional feat that must be an archetype (dedication/multiclass) feat. This compensates for the reduced general feat count from our merged feat track (see [Feats](08-feats.md)) and enables broader character customization as a baseline rather than an opt-in rule.

## Spell Lists — Four Traditions

Full tradition access for all casters. No curated sublists within a tradition. Restriction comes through mana pool size, max spell rank, and prepared vs spontaneous casting — not list limitation.

- **Arcane** — material + matter (studied, formulaic)
- **Divine** — spiritual + matter (faith, healing, cosmic forces)
- **Primal** — material + spirit (nature, elements, transformation)
- **Occult** — spiritual + mind (emotions, consciousness, mental)

See [Spellcasting](10-spellcasting.md) for the mana system that replaces Vancian slots.
