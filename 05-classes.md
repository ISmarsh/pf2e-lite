# Classes

## Roster (11 Classes)

Three martials covering the physical stats, a full caster and an empowered class for each of the four spell traditions. Empowered classes express their tradition through class features and focus spells — no mana pool.

| Class | Role | Primary Stat | Tradition | Tier |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| **Fighter** | STR martial | STR | — | Martial |
| **Rogue** | DEX martial | DEX | — | Martial |
| **Barbarian** | CON martial | STR/CON | — | Martial |
| **Wizard** | Arcane full caster | INT | Arcane | Full Caster |
| **Artificer** | Arcane-empowered crafter | INT | Arcane | Empowered |
| **Cleric** | Divine full caster | WIS | Divine | Full Caster |
| **Champion** | Divine-empowered martial | STR | Divine | Empowered |
| **Druid** | Primal full caster | WIS | Primal | Full Caster |
| **Ranger** | Primal-empowered martial | DEX | Primal | Empowered |
| **Bard** | Occult full caster | CHA | Occult | Full Caster |
| **Thaumaturge** | Occult-empowered martial | CHA | Occult | Empowered |

### Class Tiers

| Tier | Magic Access | Resource |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Martial** | Focus spells from subclass/feats | Focus points |
| **Empowered** | Tradition-flavored class features + focus spells | Signature mechanic + focus points |
| **Full Caster** | Full tradition spell list + focus spells | Mana pool + focus points |

Mana is a full-caster-only system. Empowered classes get their magic through class features, not through a spell pool.

### Stat Balance

- **STR:** Fighter, Barbarian, Champion — 3 classes
- **DEX:** Rogue, Ranger — 2 classes
- **INT:** Wizard, Artificer — 2 classes
- **WIS:** Cleric, Druid — 2 classes
- **CHA:** Bard, Thaumaturge — 2 classes

Every mental stat has exactly two classes. STR has three (appropriate since it's the martial stat with three martials).

## Ported Classes

All non-Artificer classes port directly from PF2e Remastered. Mechanical chassis, subclasses, and class feats are all ORC-licensed. Golarion-specific flavor text must be rewritten as original human-created content. Thaumaturge is from Dark Archive (ORC-licensed).

### Fighter

- **No formal subclass.** Differentiated entirely through feat choices — combat style emerges from class feat selections.
- Ports directly, no changes.

### Rogue

- **Rackets (4):** Ruffian, Scoundrel, Thief, Eldritch Trickster
- Eldritch Trickster: grants a free full caster multiclass dedication at level 1. Under our system, this means choosing Wizard, Cleric, Druid, or Bard dedication, gaining cantrips and eventual mana access through Basic Spellcasting (see [Dedications](15-dedications.md)).
- All port directly.

### Barbarian

- **Instincts (6):** Animal, Dragon, Fury, Giant, Spirit, Superstition
- All mechanical, no Golarion dependencies. Dragon references generic dragon types.
- All port directly.

### Wizard

- **Schools:** Reworked in Remaster to curriculum-based system (Ars Grammatica, Battle Magic, Civic Wizardry, etc.)
- All mechanical frameworks defining bonus spells and school abilities.
- Port directly, may rename for flavor later.

### Cleric

- **Doctrines (2):** Cloistered Cleric (full caster focused), Warpriest (more martial)
- Plus domain selection granting focus spells. Domains reference generic divine concepts, not Golarion deities.
- Port directly.

### Druid

- **Orders (4):** Animal, Leaf, Storm, Wild
- Each grants a focus spell, skill training, and an anathema (behavioral restriction).
- Anathemas are flavorful but generic ("don't harm animals unnecessarily").
- Port directly.

### Champion

- **Causes (3):** Paladin (offensive), Redeemer (defensive/redemption), Liberator (mobility/freedom)
- Each defines your Champion's Reaction effect. PF2e Remaster is tenets-based rather than alignment-based.
- Port directly.

### Ranger

- **Hunter's Edges (3):** Flurry (reduced MAP), Precision (bonus damage first hit), Outwit (skill bonuses against prey)
- All purely mechanical.
- Port directly.

### Bard

- **Muses (4):** Enigma (knowledge), Maestro (composition), Polymath (versatility), Warrior (combat)
- Full occult caster with mana pool. Compositions are focus spells (separate from mana).
- Port directly. Bard fills the occult full caster slot — the broadly desired class fantasy, strong skill utility, and compositions make it the natural choice over Psychic for the core roster.

### Thaumaturge

- **Implements (9):** Amulet (defense), Bell (debuff), Chalice (healing), Lantern (revelation), Mirror (positioning), Regalia (social/aura), Tome (knowledge), Wand (ranged magic), Weapon (martial striker)
- Pick first implement at level 1, second at level 5. One upgrades to adept at level 7.
- **Exploit Vulnerability** (1 action): Study a creature, identify or create a weakness. Your Strikes become magical and trigger the weakness. Personal Antithesis guarantees bonus damage (2 + half level) even on failure.
- **Esoteric Lore:** CHA-based special knowledge skill for identifying all creatures.
- **Scroll Thaumaturgy:** Can activate scrolls from any tradition using class DC — reflects broad esoteric knowledge despite occult tradition association.
- No formal subclass — implements ARE the specialization. Low play complexity (pick 2 of 9), high build variety.
- Evolved from PF1e Occultist. Ports directly from Dark Archive (ORC-licensed).
- **Note:** Thaumaturge has no tradition in PF2e (no spellcasting). For our grid, we assign occult tradition to any focus spells gained through feats, matching the class's flavor and lineage.

## Artificer (New Design)

The only fully new class. Modeled on PF2e Alchemist's chassis — defined by its infusion/preparation system, not by spellcasting. See [Artificer](06-artificer.md) for the complete design.

## Empowered Class Signature Mechanics

Each empowered class has a signature mechanic that defines its identity. No mana — magic comes through class features and focus spells.

| Class | Tradition | Signature Mechanic | Resource |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Champion | Divine | Champion's Reaction + Lay on Hands | Reaction + focus points |
| Ranger | Primal | Hunt Prey + Hunter's Edge | Free (one action) + warden spells via feats |
| Artificer | Arcane | Tamper + subclass production (daily prep) | 1 action/round + daily prep slots + focus points |
| Thaumaturge | Occult | Exploit Vulnerability + Implements | 1 action/round + implement abilities |

## Expansion Candidates

Classes reserved for future expansion:

- **Psychic** — CHA occult caster with conscious minds, amps, and Unleash Psyche. Powerful and mechanically distinct but complex — 6 conscious minds, per-cantrip amp modifications, crash state management. Strong expansion class for experienced players. Streamlining candidates: standardize amps, simplify Unleash Psyche crash to "can't Unleash again this combat."
- **Monk** — Unarmed/unarmored martial. Interesting but niche for core.
- **Sorcerer** — Overlaps with Wizard in arcane caster space. Bloodline mechanics are cool expansion content.
- **Witch** — CHA occult caster with familiar. Familiar management complexity deferred; strong expansion class.
- **Magus** — Arcane gish with Spellstrike. Strong expansion with established dedication template.
- **Swashbuckler** — Stylish martial with panache. Overlaps with Rogue niche.
- **Inventor, Oracle, Summoner, Kineticist** — All specialized, all expansion material.
