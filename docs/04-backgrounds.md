# Backgrounds

Backgrounds represent a character's life before adventuring. All mechanics ported directly from PF2e Remastered under ORC. Full data in `.aon-cache/background-data.json` (64 backgrounds: 40 Player Core, 24 Player Core 2).

Backgrounds slot between ancestry and class selection during character creation (see [Character Creation](02-character-creation.md)). They should be quick to choose and immediately evocative.

## Mechanical Framework

Every background grants:

- **Two ability boosts** -- one fixed (choice of two attributes), one free
- **Trained** in one skill
- **Trained** in one Lore subcategory
- **One skill feat** (must be available at level 1)

## Selection

**Common (56):** All setting-neutral and available to any character. 40 from Player Core, 16 from Player Core 2.

**Rare (8):** Special mechanics beyond the standard framework. Require GM approval. Includes Amnesiac, Blessed, Cursed, Feral Child, Feybound, Haunted, Returned, Royalty.

## Design Notes

- **All 56 common backgrounds ported.** Every remastered background is already setting-neutral. The original plan to curate 15-20 was unnecessary -- none reference Golarion-specific content.
- **Lore subcategories** with player-chosen topics (Terrain, City, etc.) add flavor at zero mechanical cost.
- **Raised by Belief** references deities -- use with setting-appropriate pantheon. In pantheonless settings, treat the "deity" as a defining ideal, philosophy, or cosmic force and work with the player to set appropriate edicts and anathema.
- **Rare backgrounds** should be offered sparingly. Amnesiac, Haunted, and Feybound require significant GM investment. Blessed and Returned grant mechanical benefits (innate cantrip, Diehard) that other backgrounds don't.
