# Ancestries

## Core Ancestries (7)

All mechanics ported directly from PF2e Remastered under ORC. Golarion-specific lore stripped; flavor text to be human-written original content. Each ancestry's relationship to the Aether and the Physical/Mental dimensions (see [Setting](19-setting.md)) should inform their flavor -- e.g., Elves as more attuned to the Mental dimensions (explaining their magical affinity and fragility), Dwarves as deeply rooted in Physical space (explaining their hardiness and constitution).

| Ancestry | HP | Size | Speed | Notable Features |
|----------|-----|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Human** | 8 | Medium | 25 ft | Extra general feat at 1st, most flexible |
| **Dwarf** | 10 | Medium | 20 ft | Darkvision, hardy, slow but tough |
| **Elf** | 6 | Medium | 30 ft | Low-light vision, fast but fragile |
| **Gnome** | 8 | Small | 25 ft | Low-light vision, fey-touched, hardy small option |
| **Goblin** | 6 | Small | 25 ft | Darkvision, scrappy |
| **Halfling** | 6 | Small | 25 ft | Keen Eyes, lucky, brave |
| **Orc** | 10 | Medium | 25 ft | Darkvision, ferocity |

## Size/HP Grid

| | Small | Medium |
|---|---|---|
| **6 HP** | Goblin, Halfling | Elf |
| **8 HP** | Gnome | Human |
| **10 HP** | — | Dwarf, Orc |

Good coverage. Every class archetype has at least 3-4 strong ancestry pairings. The only empty cell (Small 10 HP) is a niche fantasy not needed for core.

## Ancestry Mechanics

- **Attribute boosts:** Remaster system — two free boosts, no fixed ancestry boosts/flaws
- **Ancestry feats:** Levels 1, 5, 9 (three picks, see [Feats](08-feats.md))
- **Heritage selection:** One heritage chosen at level 1
- **Languages, senses, size, speed:** Per ancestry table above

## Class Pairing Highlights

- **STR martials** (Fighter, Barbarian, Champion): Dwarf and Orc (10 HP) are best. Human (8 HP) strong. Gnome (8 HP) is the viable Small option.
- **DEX martials** (Rogue, Ranger): Elf (speed), Halfling/Goblin (Small, senses), Human (flexibility) all strong.
- **Full casters** (Wizard, Cleric, Druid, Bard): Any ancestry works; HP matters less for backline.
- **Empowered** (Champion, Ranger, Artificer, Thaumaturge): Balance of survivability and utility; Human and Gnome are versatile picks.

"Costly" pairings (e.g., Elf Barbarian at 6 HP) aren't traps — they're meaningful tradeoffs that reward playing against type.

## Versatile Heritages

Versatile Heritages (Tiefling, Aasimar, Changeling, Dhampir, etc.) can apply to any ancestry. Deferred to expansion — they add a great customization layer but aren't essential for core.
