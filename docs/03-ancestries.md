# Ancestries

## Core Ancestries (7)

All mechanics ported directly from PF2e Remastered under ORC. Full data in `.aon-cache/ancestry-data.json` and `.aon-cache/heritage-data.json`. Golarion-specific lore stripped; flavor text to be human-written original content. Each ancestry's relationship to the Aether and the Physical/Mental dimensions (see [Setting](19-setting.md)) should inform their flavor -- e.g., Elves as more attuned to the Mental dimensions (explaining their magical affinity and fragility), Dwarves as deeply rooted in Physical space (explaining their hardiness and constitution).

**Selected:** Human, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goblin, Halfling, Orc (7 of 23 remastered ancestries). Heritages: 43 total across the 7 ancestries (5-7 per ancestry).

## Design Analysis

**Size/HP coverage:** 6 HP (Goblin, Halfling, Elf), 8 HP (Gnome, Human), 10 HP (Dwarf, Orc). Small and Medium both represented at each HP tier except Small 10 HP (a niche fantasy not needed for core). Good coverage -- every class archetype has at least 3-4 strong ancestry pairings.

**Ancestry mechanics (ported as-is):** Two free attribute boosts (no fixed ancestry boosts/flaws), one heritage at level 1, ancestry feats at levels 1/5/9 (see [Feats](08-feats.md)).

**Half-Elf and Half-Orc** are Human heritages that unlock another ancestry's feat tree -- one of PF2e's best design decisions.

## Class Pairing Highlights

- **STR martials** (Fighter, Barbarian, Champion): Dwarf and Orc (10 HP) are best. Human (8 HP) strong. Gnome (8 HP) is the viable Small option.
- **DEX martials** (Rogue, Ranger): Elf (speed), Halfling/Goblin (Small, senses), Human (flexibility) all strong.
- **Full casters** (Wizard, Cleric, Druid, Bard): Any ancestry works; HP matters less for backline.
- **Empowered** (Champion, Ranger, Artificer, Thaumaturge): Balance of survivability and utility; Human and Gnome are versatile picks.

"Costly" pairings (e.g., Elf Barbarian at 6 HP) aren't traps -- they're meaningful tradeoffs that reward playing against type.

## Versatile Heritages

Versatile Heritages (Tiefling, Aasimar, Changeling, Dhampir, etc.) can apply to any ancestry. Deferred to expansion -- they add a great customization layer but aren't essential for core.
