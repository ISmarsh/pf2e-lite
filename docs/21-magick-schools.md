# Magick Schools

> **Source:** Adapted from SMARS design documents. Defines six schools of magick based on what magic *does*, tied to the Aether cosmogony.
>
> **Status:** School definitions complete. Integration with PF2e's four traditions (Arcane, Divine, Primal, Occult) is an open question -- see [Open Questions](18-open-questions.md#magick-schools-integration-approach).

## Overview

PF2e Remastered removed its old spell schools (Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, etc.), leaving a classification vacuum. SMARS introduces six schools based on what magic *does* to its subject, tied to the Mental dimensions of the cosmogony. These schools sit at the intersection of three independent taxonomic axes, creating a structurally elegant system.

The six schools spell **MAGICK**: Mutation, Artifice, Genesis, Illusion, Clarifice, Knosis.

PF2e also has four **traditions** (Arcane, Divine, Occult, Primal) that determine which spells a class can access, based on *where* the magic comes from. Schools and traditions are orthogonal -- schools classify what a spell does, traditions describe how you access it. Whether both systems are needed mechanically is an open question.

## The Six Schools of MAGICK

Each school maps to one or two Mental abilities:

| School | Ability | Domain |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Mutation** | INT | Adaptation of complex matter |
| **Artifice** | INT / CHA | Construction of simple matter |
| **Genesis** | CHA | Creation of basic matter and emotion |
| **Illusion** | CHA / WIS | Alteration of perception |
| **Clarifice** | WIS | Restoration of matter and thoughts |
| **Knosis** | WIS / INT | Discovery and transfer of thoughts |

Every Mental ability has one "pure" school and two "hybrid" schools shared with adjacent abilities:

- **INT pure:** Mutation. **INT hybrids:** Knosis (WIS/INT), Artifice (INT/CHA)
- **CHA pure:** Genesis. **CHA hybrids:** Illusion (CHA/WIS), Artifice (INT/CHA)
- **WIS pure:** Clarifice. **WIS hybrids:** Illusion (CHA/WIS), Knosis (WIS/INT)

## Three Taxonomic Axes

### 1. Physical / Mental

Each school primarily affects either matter or mind:

- **Physical side:** Genesis, Artifice, Mutation
- **Mental side:** Illusion, Knosis, Clarifice

### 2. Complexity Tier

A progression from raw/crude to sophisticated, mirroring the cosmogony's cascade from basic elements to complex life:

| Tier | Physical School | Mental School |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Basic** | Genesis -- conjuring raw elemental matter | Illusion -- crude sensory tricks, raw emotional manipulation |
| **Simple** | Artifice -- assembling matter into functional forms | Knosis -- structured thought transfer, reading minds |
| **Complex** | Mutation -- transforming living/sapient matter | Clarifice -- restoring minds and matter to their true/whole state |

### 3. Action Type

What the school *does* to its subject:

| Action Type | Schools | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Fundamental** | Genesis + Knosis | Reaching into the raw substrate -- creating matter from nothing, accessing thoughts at their source |
| **Transformative** | Illusion + Mutation | Changing what already exists into something different |
| **Constructive / Restorative** | Artifice + Clarifice | Assembling or returning things to functional, ordered states |

The naming pairs reinforce this: Genesis/Knosis share the "reaching into origin" feel. Artifice/Clarifice share the "-ifice" suffix -- making, building, restoring to wholeness. Illusion/Mutation are both about altering the state of something that already exists.

## Summary Matrix

| School | Physical / Mental | Complexity | Action Type | Ability |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| **M**utation | Physical | Complex | Transformative | INT |
| **A**rtifice | Physical | Simple | Constructive | INT / CHA |
| **G**enesis | Physical | Basic | Fundamental | CHA |
| **I**llusion | Mental | Basic | Transformative | CHA / WIS |
| **C**larifice | Mental | Complex | Constructive | WIS |
| **K**nosis | Mental | Simple | Fundamental | WIS / INT |

## Cosmogony Connection

The schools recapitulate the Aether cascade (see [Setting](19-setting.md)):

- **Genesis** operates at the **Basic** tier -- raw creation from the Aether, like the original condensation of energy into matter.
- **Artifice** operates at the **Simple** tier -- assembling raw matter into functional structures, like the formation of stars and planets.
- **Mutation** operates at the **Complex** tier -- transforming living systems, like the emergence of complex life.
- The Mental schools mirror this progression: raw perception tricks (Illusion), structured thought (Knosis), restoration of complex systems (Clarifice).

## Spell Classification Criteria

Draft rubric for assigning spells to schools. **Actual spell assignments are deferred** until the integration approach (see below) is decided.

### Mutation (INT) -- Adaptation of complex matter

Classifies spells that transform, polymorph, enhance physical abilities, or transmute.

- Animal Form, Dragon Form (transforming complex matter)
- Enlarge, Shrink (adapting physical form)
- Haste, Slow (altering biological processes)
- Flesh to Stone (transmuting complex matter)
- Fly on self (adapting the body)

### Artifice (INT/CHA) -- Construction of simple matter

Classifies spells that create structures, barriers, tools, or functional forms from matter.

- Wall of Stone, Wall of Fire (constructing barriers)
- Mage Hand, Telekinetic Haul (constructing force-structures)
- Floating Disk (constructing a functional object)
- Glyph of Warding (constructing a magical mechanism)
- Lock, Knock (constructing/deconstructing mechanisms)

### Genesis (CHA) -- Creation of basic matter and emotion

Classifies spells that conjure matter or energy from nothing, create elemental effects, or evoke raw emotions.

- Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Cone of Cold (creating elemental energy)
- Create Food, Create Water (conjuring basic matter)
- Fear, Heroism (creating raw emotional states)
- Light, Darkness (creating or negating basic energy)
- Summon spells (pulling matter/creatures from the Aether -- contested, see below)

### Illusion (CHA/WIS) -- Alteration of perception

Classifies spells that deceive senses, create false images, or manipulate what others perceive.

- Invisibility, Mirror Image (altering visual perception)
- Silence (altering auditory perception)
- Charm, Suggestion (altering perception of the caster/situation)
- Phantasmal Killer (weaponized false perception)
- Disguise (altering perception of appearance)

### Clarifice (WIS) -- Restoration of matter and thoughts

Classifies spells that heal, cure, restore, purify, reveal truth, or dispel.

- Heal, Restore Senses, Remove Disease (restoring body to healthy state)
- Dispel Magic, Cleanse Affliction (restoring to un-enchanted state)
- True Seeing, See the Unseen (restoring true perception)
- Calm Emotions (restoring emotional baseline)

### Knosis (WIS/INT) -- Discovery and transfer of thoughts

Classifies spells that detect, identify, communicate, read minds, or divine.

- Detect Magic, Identify (discovering magical properties)
- Telepathy, Message, Sending (thought transfer)
- Augury, Divination (discovering future/hidden information)
- Comprehend Languages (accessing linguistic knowledge)

## Contested Spells

Some spells don't fit neatly into one school. These need explicit rulings before any classification pass:

| Spell | Candidate Schools | The Tension |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Summon [Creature]** | Genesis vs. Mutation | Creating matter from Aether, or transforming Aether into a creature? |
| **Teleport** | Genesis vs. Knosis vs. Artifice | Moving through dimensional pathways touches multiple schools |
| **Shield/Protection** | Clarifice vs. Artifice | Restoring defensive integrity vs. constructing a barrier |
| **Buff spells (Haste, etc.)** | Mutation vs. Artifice | Changing the creature vs. building an enhancement onto them |
| **Fear/Emotion spells** | Genesis vs. Illusion | Creating emotion vs. altering perception |
| **Counterspell/Dispel** | Clarifice vs. target school | Restoring to unenchanted state vs. understanding and unraveling the spell |
| **Raise Dead/Resurrect** | Clarifice vs. Mutation vs. Genesis | Restoring life vs. transforming death vs. creating life force |
| **Banishment** | Genesis vs. Knosis | Sending through dimensional pathways vs. understanding planar connections |
| **Curses** | Mutation vs. Illusion | Transforming the target vs. altering their perceived reality |

### Classification Principle

When a spell could belong to multiple schools, prefer the school that matches its **primary intent**:

- If the spell's purpose is to *create something new*, it's Genesis or Artifice
- If the spell's purpose is to *change what exists*, it's Mutation or Illusion
- If the spell's purpose is to *restore or reveal*, it's Clarifice or Knosis

Then use the Physical/Mental axis to disambiguate: does the spell primarily affect matter or mind?

## Draft Class Affinity Mapping

Speculative mapping of how classes might relate to schools. This is **not finalized** and depends on the integration approach decision.

| Class | Natural Affinity | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Wizard** | Mutation, Knosis, Artifice | INT-primary. Scholarly magic: transformation, discovery, construction. |
| **Cleric** | Clarifice, Knosis | WIS-primary. Restoration, divine knowledge, perception of truth. |
| **Druid** | Mutation, Clarifice, Genesis | WIS/INT. Natural transformation, restoration, elemental creation. |
| **Bard** | Illusion, Genesis, Artifice | CHA-primary. Performance, emotional manipulation, spectacle. |
| **Champion** | Clarifice | WIS-adjacent divine. Healing, protection, reinforcing the true state. |
| **Ranger** | Mutation, Knosis | WIS/INT. Nature adaptation, scouting, discovery. |
| **Artificer** | Artifice, Mutation | INT-primary. Construction and adaptation of matter. |
| **Thaumaturge** | Knosis, Illusion | CHA-primary. Esoteric knowledge, perception beyond normal. |

### Expansion Classes (Speculative)

| Class | Natural Affinity | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Sorcerer | Genesis, Illusion, Mutation | CHA-primary. Raw creation, innate power, unstable transformation. |
| Oracle | Knosis, Clarifice, Illusion | WIS-primary. Prophecy, healing, perception beyond normal. |
| Witch | Knosis, Illusion, Mutation | WIS/INT. Hidden knowledge, perception tricks, curses. |
| Magus | Mutation, Artifice | INT-primary. Limited schools, martial hybrid. Enhancement and construction for combat. |
| Psychic | Knosis, Illusion, Clarifice | WIS/INT/CHA. Pure Mental magic -- thought transfer, perception, restoration. |

## Integration with PF2e Traditions: Open Question

The relationship between schools and traditions is the system's most consequential open design decision. Three approaches:

### Option A: Schools Replace Traditions

Every spell belongs to one school. Classes get access to schools rather than traditions.

**Pros:** Cleaner (one system), tied to cosmogony, fills remaster vacuum, more expressive class identity.
**Cons:** Biggest PF2e departure, requires full 406-spell reclassification, loses Cleric/Druid flavor distinction when both use Clarifice, harder for PF2e players to adopt.

### Option B: Schools Layer on Top of Traditions

Traditions stay as class-flavor access gates. Every spell also gets a school tag. Both systems coexist.

**Pros:** Maximum PF2e compatibility, traditions preserve class identity, schools add new dimension without breaking balance, easier adoption.
**Cons:** Two overlapping classification systems, school taxonomy not used to its potential, doesn't address "traditions feel arbitrary" complaint.

### Option C: Schools Replace Mechanics, Traditions Become Flavor

Schools are the mechanical access system. "Arcane," "Divine," "Occult," "Primal" become purely narrative descriptors of *how* a character accesses the Aether, with no mechanical weight.

**Pros:** Clean mechanics + preserved flavor, consistent with cosmogony (one source of magic), opens multiclass/hybrid casters naturally.
**Cons:** Still requires full spell reclassification, "traditions as flavor only" may feel like a loss.

### Decision Criteria

Key factors for resolving this:

1. **How much PF2e compatibility matters.** If players should be able to bring PF2e characters with minimal conversion, Option B. If this is its own system, Option A or C.
2. **Whether the 406-spell classification pass is worth the effort.** Options A and C require it. Option B adds school tags without removing traditions.
3. **Class identity.** Do classes feel distinct enough when defined by school access alone, or do traditions add necessary flavor?
4. **Playtesting.** A sample classification of 20-30 iconic spells would stress-test the rubric before committing to the full pass.

### Recommended Next Step

Regardless of approach, a **sample spell classification** of 20-30 iconic spells would validate the rubric and surface edge cases. This can be done before committing to A/B/C.

## Open Questions

- Which integration approach (A/B/C) to adopt -- see above
- How many schools does a class get? Two primary + one secondary? Three total? Scaling access with level?
- Can any class access any school through feats/multiclass? How restricted?
- Do martial classes get minor school access? (Fighter with a touch of Mutation for self-buffs?)
- Does school access replace or supplement the existing spell list?
- How does the mana system interact with school count? (More schools = more versatility but same pool)
- Where do protective/defensive spells go? If all healing AND all protection is Clarifice, WIS casters become mandatory.
- Where's the line between Illusion (altering perception of emotion) and Genesis (creating raw emotion)?
- Does Clarifice's "reveal truth" function overlap with Knosis's divination?
