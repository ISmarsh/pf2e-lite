## The Aether

In a universe much younger and smaller than the one you're in now, there was naught but a single point of infinite energy. This may have been the result of a previous universe collapsing at the end of its existence, or possibly an infallible deity punching "infinity / 0" into a cosmic calculator. Whether entropy endgame or erroneous ethereal equation, energy emerged and expanded.

This energy, which we'll call **The Aether**, expanded out into nothingness, which became somethingness.

## The Cascade

Over time the Aether condensed into varying states of matter: **Fire, Air, Water, and Earth**. These aren't the proper English names for the four states of matter, but there probably won't be an England in this universe anyway.

The cascade mirrors the real-world cooling of the early universe: plasma -> gas -> liquid -> solid, flavored as Fire -> Air -> Water -> Earth. This gives the creation story a grounding in real physics while keeping the mythic tone.

## The Dimensions

The newly formed matter was confined to three dimensions of **Physical** space. It gradually formed the first stars, and eventually the first galaxies. Planets formed around the stars, and moons formed around the planets.

The remaining Aether, wanting little to do with the restrictions of the Physical world, coalesced into a **Mental** space with three dimensions.

### Physical Dimensions (from condensed Aether/matter)

- **Strength** -- raw physical power
- **Dexterity** -- agility, reflexes, balance
- **Constitution** -- endurance, health, stamina

### Mental Dimensions (from uncondensed Aether)

- **Intelligence** -- analytical reasoning, memory, learning
- **Wisdom** -- perception, intuition, insight
- **Charisma** -- force of personality, presence, willpower

The six ability scores are not arbitrary game abstractions -- they are the fundamental dimensions of this universe. Physical abilities map to condensed matter. Mental abilities map to the Aether's uncondensed state.

## The Emergence of Life

The evolution of life on various celestial bodies followed. Most early life consisted of **Simple Creatures** -- beings existing only in Physical space: Elementals, Plants, and Animals.

There are places where the Physical and Mental dimensions intersect, and it's in those places that sapient, **Complex Creatures** emerge. Humanoids, Constructs, and Chimeras -- beings that bridge both Physical and Mental space.

See [Creature Taxonomy](20-creature-taxonomy.md) for the full classification system.

### The Sapience Bridge (Working Concept)

There's currently a jump between "Aether coalesces into Mental space" and "Complex Creatures emerge at intersections." A middle step is needed to explain *why* the intersection produces sapience.

Working concept: all matter originated from the Aether, so Simple Creatures carry a residual trace of that original energy. In certain conditions, that residual Aether resonates with the Mental dimensions, and the creature becomes something more -- a bridge between Physical and Mental space. This creates a spectrum rather than a binary, and provides an in-world explanation for why some species are more magically attuned than others.

## Magick

The source of the Aether remains very inconveniently outside of both Physical and Mental dimensions, but continues to supply the universe with its energy via arcane dimensional pathways. Certain permutations of thought and matter allow one to tap into this energy, and the study and practice of these techniques is called **Magick**.

Magick is organized into six schools -- **M**utation, **A**rtifice, **G**enesis, **I**llusion, **C**larifice, **K**nosis -- each corresponding to one or two Mental dimensions. See [Magick Schools](21-magick-schools.md) for the full taxonomy.

### Mana

Mana represents how much Aether a caster can safely channel. Lore-wise, casting a spell means opening a dimensional pathway and directing the resulting energy through learned techniques. The mana pool represents a character's capacity for this -- limited by training, mental fortitude, and the body's tolerance for channeled Aether.

See [Spellcasting](10-spellcasting.md) for the mana system mechanics.

## Design Notes

### What's Deliberate

- The six ability scores as literal cosmological dimensions is intentional. It gives the stats narrative weight beyond game mechanics.
- The cascade (Fire/Air/Water/Earth) mapping to states of matter (plasma/gas/liquid/solid) grounds the fantasy in intuitive physics.
- Simple vs Complex creatures as a Physical-only vs Physical+Mental distinction drives the creature taxonomy and gives GMs structured creature design guidance.
- Magick as Aether channeling provides a single unified source for all magical traditions, which supports the six-school taxonomy.

### What's Flavor vs. Mechanical

- The cosmogony is pure flavor -- it doesn't change any PF2e mechanics.
- The dimensional framework provides thematic grounding for ability scores but doesn't alter how they function.
- The creature taxonomy has mechanical implications (see [Creature Taxonomy](20-creature-taxonomy.md)).
- The magick school system has potential mechanical implications depending on the integration approach chosen (see [Magick Schools](21-magick-schools.md) and [Open Questions](18-open-questions.md)).

## Golarion Replacement

This setting framework replaces all Golarion-specific content required under ORC licensing:

| Golarion Element | Replacement |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Golarion world lore | Aether cosmogony |
| Named deities | TBD -- divine concepts tied to Aether/dimensions |
| Planar cosmology | Physical/Mental dimensional framework |
| Creature lore | Creature taxonomy (Simple/Complex hierarchy) |
| Magic source lore | Aether channeling, six schools |

Specific deity replacements, location names, and cultural flavor text are deferred to the flavor writing phase (human-written content only, per AI policy).
