# Dedications

## Overview

Multiclass dedications allow any character to gain basic features of another class by spending class feats (or Free Archetype feats, since Free Archetype is standard). Ported from PF2e with mana conversion for caster dedications.

**Restriction (per PF2e):** Can't take a new Dedication until you've taken at least two other feats from your current archetype. Prevents cherry-picking.

## Three Dedication Templates

### Full Caster Dedications (Wizard, Cleric, Druid, Bard)

- **Dedication feat (level 2):** Cantrips + trained in tradition's spell attacks/DCs + class-specific minor feature
- **Basic Spellcasting (level 4):** Mana progression (quarter caster, see [Spellcasting](10-spellcasting.md))
- **Basic Class Feat (level 4):** Pick a class feat of half your level or lower
- **Advanced Class Feat (level 6):** Pick a class feat of your level or lower

### Empowered Dedications (Champion, Ranger, Artificer, Thaumaturge)

- **Dedication feat (level 2):** Signature mechanic + skill training
- **Basic Class Feat (level 4):** Pick a class feat of half your level or lower
- **Advanced Class Feat (level 6):** Pick a class feat of your level or lower
- **Signature Mechanic Expansion (level 8):** Deepens the signature feature
- **No mana path** — empowered classes don't grant spellcasting through dedications

Key difference from full caster dedications: the dedication feat grants the signature mechanic instead of cantrips. No Basic Spellcasting option.

### Martial Dedications (Fighter, Rogue, Barbarian, Monk)

- **Dedication feat (level 2):** Weapon/armor training + reduced signature feature
- **Basic Class Feat (level 4):** Pick a class feat of half your level or lower
- **Advanced Class Feat (level 6):** Pick a class feat of your level or lower
- **No spellcasting path**

| Formulas known | Extensive, grows each level | 4 common formulas |
| Subclass | Yes (L1 choice) | No (limited L8 access) |
| Focus spells | Via feat investment | Via Basic/Advanced Class Feat |
| Crafting auto-scaling | Expert@3, Master@7 | Just trained |

## Eldritch Trickster Resolution

Rogue's Eldritch Trickster racket grants a free **full caster** multiclass dedication at level 1. Player chooses Wizard, Cleric, Druid, or Bard — gaining cantrips and eventual mana access through Basic Spellcasting.

## Generic Archetypes

Non-multiclass archetypes that provide thematic specialization through self-contained feat chains. With Free Archetype as standard (see [Core Rules](01-core-rules.md)), every character gets archetype feats at levels 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 — generic archetypes compete with multiclass dedications for these slots.

All archetypes below are from Player Core 2 (ORC-licensed, remastered). Core vs expansion placement TBD at compilation phase.

### High Priority — Port-Ready, Broadly Useful

#### Marshal

- **Prerequisite:** Trained in Diplomacy or Intimidation; trained in martial weapons
- **Grants:** Trained (or expert) in Diplomacy or Intimidation. While conscious, 15-ft aura granting +1 status bonus to saves vs fear.
- **Feat chain (14 feats in L2-L10, plus 4 over cap):** Three stance options (Dread Marshal at L4, Inspiring Marshal at L4, Strategist at L4), support actions (Snap Out of It!, Steel Yourself!, Cadence Call), charge abilities (Rallying Charge, To Battle!), tactical feats (Back to Back, Know Your Enemy, Topple Foe, Form Up!). 4 additional feats at L12-L14 naturally excluded by level cap.
- **System flags:** References Frightened condition (kept in our 20). **Ports cleanly.**
- Fills a unique party-leadership role no class covers via multiclass. Deep feat chain with meaningful stance choices.

#### Medic

- **Prerequisite:** Battle Medicine feat; trained in Medicine
- **Grants:** Expert in Medicine, circumstance bonus to HP healed (+5 at DC 20, +10 at DC 30, +15 at DC 40). Once/day use Battle Medicine on a temporarily immune creature (once/hour at master).
- **Feat chain (L2-L6, 4 feats):** Doctor's Visitation (L4, Stride + Treat Wounds/Battle Medicine), Treat Condition (L4, reduce Clumsy/Enfeebled/Sickened), Holistic Care (L6, reduce Frightened/Stupefied/Stunned). Resuscitate at L16 naturally excluded by level cap.
- **System flags:** Expert Medicine in our system auto-grants 10-min Treat Wounds immunity (see [Skills](07-skills.md#proficiency-benefits)). Medic's unique value is the healing bonus and Battle Medicine immunity bypass — no overlap. Treat Condition and Holistic Care reference Clumsy, Enfeebled, Sickened, Frightened, Stupefied, Stunned — all kept in our 20 conditions. **Ports cleanly.**
- Thin but high-impact chain. Four feats in L1-10 range satisfies the "two feats before next dedication" requirement while providing meaningful specialization.

#### Sentinel

- **Prerequisite:** None
- **Grants:** Trained in light and medium armor (or heavy armor if already trained in both). Armor proficiency scales with class features.
- **Feat chain (L2-L8, 5 feats):** Steel Skin (L4, comfort in armor), Armor Specialist (L6, optimize armor protection), Armored Rebuff (L8, knock back attacker), Mighty Bulwark (L8, better bulwark saves).
- **System flags:** Scaling clause references L13+ expert proficiency — naturally excluded by our L1-10 cap. **Ports cleanly.**
- Essential for squishier classes (Wizard, Bard) who want armor access via Free Archetype. No prerequisites makes it universally accessible.

#### Bastion

- **Prerequisite:** Shield Block reaction
- **Grants:** Reactive Shield (raise shield as a reaction when attacked).
- **Feat chain (L2-L12, 13 feats; only L2-L10 available in this system):** Two L1 stance feats (Everstand Stance, Agile Shield Grip) available at L4+, shield movement (Shielded Stride L4), offensive blocks (Disarming Block L4, Everstand Strike L4), defensive reactions (Reflexive Shield L6, Shield Warden L6, Quick Shield Block L8), reflection (Mirror Shield L10), durability management (Destructive Block L10, Shield Salvation L12 — above our L1-10 cap). Improved Reflexive Shield at L16 naturally excluded.
- **System flags:** We keep PF2e's "Hardness" term, so Destructive Block (L10) ports as-is. Shield Salvation (L12): above level cap, naturally excluded. **No adaptation needed.**
- Deepest feat chain of any generic archetype. Natural companion to our simplified shield system. Pairs well with Champion, Fighter, or any shield-using build.

### Medium Priority — Viable but Narrower or Blocked

- **Archer** — Ranged combat specialist. Deep feat chain (11 feats L1-L10). Includes nested Eldritch Archer sub-archetype (L6 dedication) that grants spellcasting. Basic Eldritch Archer Spellcasting (L8) grants quarter-caster mana pool (same progression as multiclass caster dedications). Eldritch Reload (L10) triggers on casting a spell using mana. Ports with mana conversion.
- **Acrobat** — Agility specialist. Clean feat chain (6 feats L1-L10). Grants scaling Acrobatics proficiency. Ports cleanly.
- **Beastmaster** — Animal companion specialist. Decent chain (6 feats L1-L10). **Blocked:** requires animal companion rules, which are not yet defined in our system. Grants primal focus spells (separate from mana — fine).
- **Blessed One** — Divine healing via Lay on Hands focus spell. Thin chain (3 feats L1-L10). Blessed Spell (L8): prerequisite "ability to cast spells using mana" (replaces "from spell slots"); effect triggers when casting a spell using mana that targets a single ally. Ports with mana conversion.
- **Archaeologist** — Exploration/knowledge specialist. Niche but clean port. Relevant for dungeon-crawl campaigns.

### Low Priority / Deferred

- **Assassin** — Stealth assassination specialist. Observed→default state, Undetected→Hidden in our two-tier detection system. Core feat Assassinate is L12, above our level cap. Functional with minor rephrasing of detection references.

### Not Yet Remastered (Legacy Candidates)

The following popular archetypes are in the APG (pre-remaster) only. They can be ported using ORC-licensed mechanics but aren't in the current remastered rules set. Future review candidates:

Cavalier, Dragon Disciple, Dual-Weapon Warrior, Duelist, Familiar Master, Gladiator, Herbalist, Martial Artist, Mauler, Poisoner, Scout, Shadowdancer, Snarecrafter, Wrestler

### System Interaction Summary

| System | Archetypes Affected | Adaptation Needed |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Shield terminology | Bastion | ✅ "Hardness" kept as-is. Destructive Block ports directly. Shield Salvation above cap. |
| Conditions (resolved) | Assassin | ✅ Observed→default, Undetected→Hidden. Minor rephrasing only. |
| Medicine proficiency | Medic | ✅ No conflict — Medic adds unique Battle Medicine bypass |
| Mana system | Archer (Eldritch Archer), Blessed One | ✅ "Spell slots" → mana. EA gets quarter-caster pool. |
| Animal companions | Beastmaster | ⚠️ Blocked until companion rules are defined |
| Level cap (L1-10) | All archetypes | ✅ Higher-level feats naturally excluded |

## Open Design Work

- ~~Bastion shield terminology~~ — ✅ Resolved. Keeping "Hardness" — Destructive Block ports as-is.
- ~~Eldritch Archer and Blessed Spell mana conversion~~ — ✅ Resolved. "Spell slots" → mana throughout.
- Animal companion rules (blocks Beastmaster, also affects Druid/Ranger)
- ~~Assassin condition mapping~~ — ✅ Resolved. Observed→default, Undetected→Hidden. Minor rephrasing only.
- Verify all multiclass dedication features against system changes (mana, conditions, etc.)
