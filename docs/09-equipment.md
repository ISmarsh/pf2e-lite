### Handwraps of Mighty Blows

| Item | Level | Price | Bulk |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Handwraps of Mighty Blows | 2 | 5 gp | — |

Worn on hands. Transfer weapon fundamental runes (potency, striking) and property runes to all unarmed attacks. Etch runes onto handwraps using the same rune costs and levels as weapons — a Monk with +1 Striking handwraps deals 2d6 with fists at the same cost as a Fighter's +1 Striking longsword.

Essential for unarmed-focused characters (primarily Monk). Without handwraps, unarmed attacks can't benefit from item bonuses to attack rolls or extra damage dice from striking runes.

### Ammunition

| Type | Price (per 10) | Bulk |
|------|----------------|------|
| Arrows | 1 sp | L |
| Bolts | 1 sp | L |
| Blowgun Darts | 5 cp | L |
| Sling Bullets | 1 cp | L |

|-------|--------|
| Agile | -4 MAP instead of -5 on 2nd attack, -8 instead of -10 on 3rd |
| Backstabber | +1 precision damage against off-guard targets |
| Deadly dX | Extra damage dice on critical hit |
| Fatal dX | Damage die changes to dX on critical hit, +1 dX |

## Shields

Uses simplified Hardness + Durability system (see [Shields](13-shields.md) for full mechanics).

### Base Shields

| Shield | AC | Hardness | Durability | Price | Bulk |
|--------|-----|-------------|------------|-------|------|
| Buckler | +1 | 3 | 2 | 1 gp | L |
| Wooden Shield | +2 | 3 | 2 | 1 gp | 1 |
| Steel Shield | +2 | 5 | 3 | 2 gp | 1 |
| Tower Shield | +2 (+4 Take Cover) | 5 | 3 | 10 gp | 4 |

> **Tower Shield:** Takes an action to set in place (Take Cover), granting +4 AC instead of +2. -5 ft speed penalty while wielding.

### Sturdy Shields

Upgraded shields with progressively better defenses. Available as loot or purchases.

| Shield | Level | Hardness | Durability | Price |
|--------|-------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Sturdy Shield (Minor) | 4 | 8 | 6 | 100 gp |
| Sturdy Shield (Lesser) | 7 | 10 | 7 | 360 gp |
| Sturdy Shield (Moderate) | 10 | 13 | 8 | 1,000 gp |

> Hardness and Durability derived from PF2e's Hardness/HP/BT. See [Conversion Formula](13-shields.md#conversion-formula) for the conversion formula and rationale.

### Material Shields

Precious material shields available in the L1-10 range:

| Material | Grade | Level | Hardness | Durability | Price | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Cold Iron | Low | 2 | Base | Base | 30-34 gp | Effective against fey, demons |
| Silver | Low | 2 | Base | Base | 30-34 gp | Effective against devils, werewolves |
| Cold Iron | Standard | 7 | Base | Base | 300-340 gp | |
| Silver | Standard | 7 | Base | Base | 300-340 gp | |
| Adamantine | Standard | 8 | Base | Base +1 | 400-440 gp | Hardest common metal |
| Dawnsilver | Standard | 8 | Base | Base +1 | 400-440 gp | Silver properties, 1 Bulk lighter |
| Duskwood | Standard | 8 | Base | Base +1 | 400-560 gp | 1 Bulk lighter (wood only) |

> "Base" = the Hardness and Durability of the underlying shield type. Special materials (Adamantine, Dawnsilver, Duskwood) gain +1 Durability for superior construction. Price range reflects buckler vs shield vs tower shield variants. See [Shields](13-shields.md) for full material progression.

## Runes

### Fundamental Runes

Fundamental runes provide the core numerical progression for weapons and armor.

#### Weapon Runes

| Rune | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Weapon Potency +1 | 2 | 35 gp | +1 item bonus to attack rolls. 1 property rune slot. |
| Striking | 4 | 65 gp | Weapon deals 2 damage dice instead of 1. |
| Weapon Potency +2 | 10 | 935 gp | +2 item bonus to attack rolls. 2 property rune slots. |

> Greater Striking (L12, 3 dice) and +3 Potency (L16) are above our level range.

#### Armor Runes

| Rune | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Armor Potency +1 | 5 | 160 gp | +1 item bonus to AC. 1 property rune slot. |
| Resilient | 8 | 340 gp | +1 item bonus to saving throws. |
| Armor Potency +2 | 11 | 1,060 gp | +2 item bonus to AC. 2 property rune slots. |

> Armor Potency +2 is level 11 — just outside our range. Characters will typically cap at +1 Resilient armor. Greater Resilient (L14) is well above range.

#### Shield Rune

| Rune | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Reinforcing (Minor) | 4 | 75 gp | +2 Hardness, +2 Durability |
| Reinforcing (Lesser) | 7 | 300 gp | +3 Hardness, +3 Durability |
| Reinforcing (Moderate) | 10 | 900 gp | +4 Hardness, +4 Durability |

> Reinforcing runes stack with shield base stats and material bonuses. A reinforced shield trails a Sturdy shield at the same level — Sturdy is the dedicated Shield Block option, Reinforcing keeps special-ability shields viable for occasional blocking. See [Shields](13-shields.md) for comparison table.

| Greater Invisibility | 10 | 1,000 gp | Up to 3/day (light armor only) |

## Staves

Magical staves give casters access to themed spell lists and extra daily casting capacity through a charge system separate from mana.

### Core Mechanics

**Preparing a staff:** During daily preparations, a caster can prepare one staff they own (and that contains at least one spell on your tradition's spell list). The staff gains **charges equal to the highest spell rank you can cast** (free, no mana cost). Only one staff per person per day.

**Casting from a staff:** Spend charges equal to the spell's rank. Uses your spell attack modifier and spell DC. The spell gains your tradition's trait and can be modified by spellshape feats. Staff cantrips are free (no charges).

**Bonus charges (prepared casters — Wizard, Cleric, Druid):** During daily prep, you may spend mana equal to a rank's mana cost to add charges equal to that rank number. Maximum one sacrifice per day.
- Example: spend 4 mana (R3 cost) to add 3 charges.

**Bonus charges (spontaneous casters — Bard):** During play, you may cast a staff spell by spending 1 charge + the mana cost of the rank you're casting at. This stretches your charges by supplementing with mana on the fly.
- Example: cast a R3 staff spell for 1 charge + 4 mana (instead of 3 charges).

**Staff weapons:** Staves can be etched with fundamental runes (potency, striking) but not property runes.

| Level | Base Charges | Max Bonus (Prepared) | Total | Mana Cost for Bonus |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------|---------------------|
| 3 | 2 | +2 | 4 | 2 mana (R2) |
| 5 | 3 | +3 | 6 | 4 mana (R3) |
| 7 | 4 | +4 | 8 | 7 mana (R4) |
| 10 | 5 | +5 | 10 | 11 mana (R5) |

### Staff Lines (L1-10, Remastered)

### What This Preserves

- **Charge management mini-game:** Allocating limited charges across multiple spell ranks remains a meaningful daily decision
- **Prepared vs. spontaneous distinction:** Different bonus charge mechanics match PF2e's different staff interactions for each caster type
- **Spell access value:** Staves provide access to spells outside your preparations or repertoire — the primary benefit alongside extra daily casts
- **Staff weapon identity:** Fundamental runes only (no property runes) — a staff is a casting implement first

### What This Simplifies

- **Unified mana conversion:** "Sacrifice a spell slot" becomes "spend mana equal to that rank's cost" for prepared casters. Same power level, one fewer concept.
- **Spontaneous charge discount maps directly:** 1 charge + 1 slot becomes 1 charge + mana. No new mechanics needed.

## Wands

Wands hold a single spell and let you cast it once per day without spending mana. Each wand contains a specific spell at a specific rank.

### Core Mechanics

**Casting from a wand:** Hold the wand and Cast the Spell using its normal actions. The spell must be on your tradition's spell list. Uses your spell attack modifier and spell DC. Frequency: once per day.

**Overcharge:** After using the wand for the day, you can attempt to cast the spell one more time. Roll a **DC 10 flat check** — on success, the wand is broken (repairable); on failure, the wand is destroyed. A wand can only be overcharged once per day.

**Crafting a wand:** Supply a casting of the spell (costs mana equal to the spell's rank cost) during the crafting process. The spell's magic is captured in the wand.

**No mana conversion needed.** Wands don't interact with spell slots in PF2e and don't interact with mana in our system — they're a self-contained 1/day resource.

### Magic Wand (Generic)

The base wand type — holds any single spell at the listed rank.

| Item Level | Spell Rank | Price |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 3 | 1st | 60 gp |
| 5 | 2nd | 160 gp |
| 7 | 3rd | 360 gp |
| 9 | 4th | 700 gp |

### Specialty Wands

Specialty wands enhance specific spells with bonus effects. 5 types from GM Core, 4 from Player Core 2. All common rarity.

| Wand | Levels | Price Range | Effect |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Wand of Widening | 4/6/8/10 | 100-1,000 gp | Increase area (burst, cone, or line); +1 action |
| Wand of Continuation | 5/7/9 | 160-700 gp | Duration increased by half; +1 action |
| Wand of Shardstorm | 5/9 | 160-700 gp | Force barrage; extra missile each turn for 1 min |
| Wand of Hopeless Night | 6/10 | 250-1,000 gp | Darkness + frightened on failed Will save |
| Wand of the Spider | 7 | 360 gp | Web + 1d6 poison on failed escape |
| Wand of Crackling Lightning | 8/10 | 500-1,000 gp | Lightning bolt double-wide + off-guard on fail |
| Wand of Smoldering Fireballs | 8 | 500 gp | Fireball + persistent fire on failed save |
| Wand of Overflowing Life | 9 | 700 gp | Heal + self-heal at start of next turn |

> 9 wand types, 20 specific variants in L1-10. All ORC licensed (GM Core + Player Core 2).

## Scrolls

Single-use consumables containing one spell at a fixed rank. Destroyed after casting. The cheapest way to access a spell you don't prepare daily.

### Core Mechanics

**Casting from a scroll:** Hold the scroll and Cast the Spell using its normal actions. The spell must be on your tradition's spell list. Uses your spell attack modifier and spell DC. The scroll is destroyed after casting.

**No mana cost.** Scrolls don't interact with spell slots in PF2e or mana in our system — the spell is pre-loaded.

**Crafting scrolls:** Supply a casting of the spell (costs mana) during the crafting process. Scrolls can be crafted in **batches of four** (same spell, same rank, one casting per scroll). See [Crafting](14-crafting.md).

### Scroll Pricing

Item level = (spell rank x 2) - 1.

| Spell Rank | Item Level | Price |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 1st | 1 | 4 gp |
| 2nd | 3 | 12 gp |
| 3rd | 5 | 30 gp |
| 4th | 7 | 70 gp |
| 5th | 9 | 150 gp |

> No specialty scroll types exist in remastered L1-10. Scrolls are the baseline consumable — GM Core: "You'll never need to design a new scroll."

### Scrolls vs. Wands

| | Scroll | Wand |
|--|--------|------|
| Uses | Single use (destroyed) | 1/day + overcharge |
| Price | 4-150 gp (R1-R5) | 60-700 gp (R1-R4) |
| Ratio | Baseline | 10-15x scroll price |
| Best for | Situational spells, emergencies | Routinely used spells |
| Batch crafting | Yes (4 per batch) | No |

## Worn Magic Items

108 remastered worn items exist in L1-10 (81 common, 25 uncommon, 2 rare). All from GM Core, Player Core 2, Rage of Elements, or Howl of the Wild (ORC licensed). Vast majority port with zero changes — no mana interaction.

### Skill Bonus Items

The backbone of the worn item economy. Each skill typically has a dedicated item line: +1 at L3-5, +2 at L9-10.

| Skill | Item | +1 (Level/Price) | +2 (Level/Price) |
|-------|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Acrobatics | Bracelet of Dashing / Arboreal Boots | L3/58 gp, L5/160 gp | L9/645 gp, L9/700 gp |

| Society | Messenger's Ring | — | L9/700 gp |
| Stealth | Clandestine Cloak (uncommon) | L6/230 gp | L10/900 gp |
| Survival | Tracker's Goggles / Coyote Cloak | L3/60 gp | L9/650-660 gp |

> Skill items follow the same investment pattern as runes: +1 becomes available around L3-5, +2 around L9-10. Most are common rarity.

### Combat Items

| Item | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Bracers of Missile Deflection | 3 | 52 gp | Activate: +2 AC vs. ranged for 1 round |
| Doubling Rings | 3 | 50 gp | Second weapon inherits first weapon's runes |
| Boots of Bounding | 7 | 340 gp | +5-ft item bonus to Speed |

### Utility Items

| Item | Level | Price | Effect |

| Choker of Elocution | 6 | 200 gp | Fluency in one extra language |
| Charm of Resistance | 6 | 245 gp | Resistance 5 to one energy type (chosen at investment) |

| Charm of Resistance (Greater) | 10 | 975 gp | Resistance 10 to one energy type |
| Choker of Elocution (Greater) | 10 | 850 gp | +2; fluency in three languages |

### Focused Items (Class-Specific, L10)

Seven L10 items (all 1,000 gp) grant 1 bonus Focus Point per day for a class-specific focus spell. Focus Point economy is preserved from PF2e — no mana conversion needed.

| Item | Class | Focus Spell Type |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Accolade Robe | Wizard | School spell |
| Entertainer's Cincture | Bard | Composition spell |
| Living Mantle | Druid | Order spell |
| Sash of Prowess | Monk | Qi spell |

> 3 additional focused items exist for expansion classes (Crown of Witchcraft/Witch, Prognostic Veil/Oracle, Sanguine Pendant/Sorcerer). No focused items exist for Champion, Ranger, Fighter, Rogue, Barbarian, Artificer, or Thaumaturge — potential gap for future design.

### Items That Cast Spells

Several worn items grant 1/day spell activations with fixed ranks and DCs baked into the item. These don't cost mana — they're self-contained activations, same as PF2e.

| Item | Level | Spell(s) |
|------|-------|----------|
| Healer's Gloves | 4 | Heal 2d6+7 (1/day) |
| Primeval Mistletoe | 6 | Runic weapon/body (1/10 min), one with plants (1/day) |
| Demon Mask (Greater) | 10 | 3rd-rank fear (DC 29) |
| Symbol of Conflict (Greater) | 10 | 4th-rank bane/bless/divine wrath/cleanse affliction (DC 27) |

### Mana Conversion Notes

- **Mage's Hat (Greater)** is the only worn item referencing prepared spells: "If you prepare arcane spells, you can change the spell." Rephrase to: "If you are an arcane caster, you can change the spell."
- **All other items** are self-contained activations (fixed DCs, no slot costs) or skill bonuses. Zero mana interaction.

### Deferred Categories

- **Aeon Stones** (10 items, all uncommon): Niche ecosystem tied to Wayfinder item. Deferred to expansion.
- **Companion Items** (5 items): Blocked on animal companion rules. See [Open Questions](18-open-questions.md).

## Talismans

Single-use magical charms affixed to weapons, armor, or shields. Activated as a free action during a specific trigger (Strike, Shield Block, Leap, etc.), then crumbles to dust. "Martial characters' answer to scrolls" — they expand non-caster options without requiring spellcasting.

### Core Mechanics

**Affixing:** 10 minutes with a repair toolkit. One talisman per item — attaching a second deactivates both.

**Activating:** Free action on a specific trigger (listed per talisman). Must be wielding or wearing the affixed item.

**No mana interaction.** Talismans are entirely self-contained consumables. No spellcasting prerequisites, no slot costs.

**Enchanter subclass relevance:** The Artificer's Enchanter subclass creates temporary enchantments. Talismans are the consumable half of that design space. See [Artificer](06-artificer.md).

> Standard-grade material weapons (L10-11) and armor (L11-12) are at the edge of our level range. Low-grade cold iron and silver weapons (L2) are the primary material interaction at early levels.

### Material Damage Interactions

| Material | Effective Against | How It Works |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Cold Iron | Fey, demons | Creatures with cold iron weakness take extra damage |
| Silver | Devils, werewolves | Bypasses some resistances, creatures with silver weakness take extra damage |

## Pricing and Economy

### Expected Wealth by Level

Per PF2e GM Core treasure tables. Use these to calibrate loot and shop availability.

| Level | Permanent Items | Currency | Total Approximate Value |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------------------|
| 1 | — | 15 gp | 15 gp |
| 2 | 1x L2 | 20 gp | 55 gp |
| 3 | 1x L3, 1x L2 | 25 gp | 120 gp |
| 4 | 1x L4, 2x L3 | 30 gp | 225 gp |
| 5 | 1x L5, 2x L4 | 50 gp | 425 gp |

| 8 | 1x L8, 2x L7 | 180 gp | 2,000 gp |
| 9 | 1x L9, 2x L8 | 250 gp | 3,100 gp |
| 10 | 1x L10, 2x L9 | 350 gp | 4,800 gp |

> Values are cumulative per character. Actual loot distribution depends on party size and campaign pacing.

### Crafting Economics

Per our crafting system (see [Crafting](14-crafting.md)):
- Material cost: 25% of item price
- Formula cost: ~10-15% of item price
- First craft total: ~35-40% of item price
- Subsequent crafts: 25% of item price

### Equipment Progression Benchmarks

Typical upgrade path for a martial character:

| Level | Weapon | Armor | Shield |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Base weapon | Starting armor | Base shield |
| 2 | +1 Weapon Potency (35 gp) | — | Low-grade material (optional) |
| 4 | +1 Striking (100 gp total) | — | Sturdy Minor (100 gp) |
| 5 | — | +1 Armor Potency (160 gp) | — |
| 7 | — | — | Sturdy Lesser (360 gp) |
| 8 | First property rune (500 gp) | Resilient (500 gp total) | — |
| 10 | +2 Striking (1,000 gp total) | — | Sturdy Moderate (1,000 gp) |

## Interaction with Artificer Infusions

Artificer infusions (see [Artificer](06-artificer.md)) occupy a separate "space" from permanent runes. A weapon can have both its normal runes **and** an active infusion without conflict. Most infusions provide qualitative capabilities (like a damage type or a utility effect), not numerical bonuses. Exception: the Enchanter subclass can create temporary fundamental runes, but standard rune restrictions prevent stacking with existing ones.

## Design Notes

- **Weapon and armor tables are straight ports** — the math is PF2e's core balance. No modifications needed.
- **Shield stats use the simplified system** from [Shields](13-shields.md). Hardness kept as-is from PF2e (same term, same values). Durability derived from expected Shield Blocks at-level. See 13-shields.md for full conversion formula.
- **Runes capped at L10** — only fundamental runes and property runes available in our range are listed. Greater/Major tiers exist in PF2e but are beyond our scope.
- **Armor Potency +2 (L11)** is technically out of range — characters will cap at +1 Armor Potency + Resilient. This is a natural power ceiling for the system.
- **Material progression matters** — cold iron and silver weapons are affordable by L2 and relevant for creature vulnerabilities. Standard-grade special materials (L8) are late-game upgrades.
- **Adventuring gear** is mostly a straight port. Level 3 upgraded toolkits are the main mechanical interaction (+1 item bonuses).
- **Magic items are overwhelmingly clean ports.** Staves are the only category requiring mana conversion (charge bonus mechanics). Wands, scrolls, worn items, talismans, and held items are all self-contained — no mana interaction. Only one item (Mage's Hat Greater) needs minor rephrasing.
