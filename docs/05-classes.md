# Classes

## Roster (12 Classes)

Four martials covering the physical stats, a full caster and an empowered class for each of the four spell traditions. Empowered classes express their tradition through class features and focus spells -- no mana pool.

| Class | Role | Primary Stat | Tradition | Tier |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| **Fighter** | STR martial | STR | -- | Martial |
| **Rogue** | DEX martial | DEX | -- | Martial |
| **Barbarian** | CON martial | STR/CON | -- | Martial |
| **Monk** | Unarmed martial | STR/DEX | -- | Martial |
| **Wizard** | Arcane full caster | INT | Arcane | Full Caster |
| **Artificer** | Arcane-empowered crafter | INT | Arcane | Empowered |
| **Cleric** | Divine full caster | WIS | Divine | Full Caster |
| **Champion** | Divine-empowered martial | STR | Divine | Empowered |
| **Druid** | Primal full caster | WIS | Primal | Full Caster |
| **Ranger** | Primal-empowered martial | DEX | Primal | Empowered |
| **Bard** | Occult full caster | CHA | Occult | Full Caster |
| **Thaumaturge** | Occult-empowered martial | CHA | Occult | Empowered |

### Class Tiers

| Tier | Magic Access | Resource |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Martial** | Optional focus spells from subclass/feats (Monk, some Barbarian instincts) | Focus points (if applicable) |
| **Empowered** | Tradition-flavored class features + focus spells | Signature mechanic + focus points |
| **Full Caster** | Full tradition spell list + focus spells | Mana pool + focus points |

Mana is a full-caster-only system. Empowered classes get their magic through class features, not through a spell pool.

### Stat Balance

- **STR:** Fighter, Barbarian, Champion, Monk -- 4 classes (Monk chooses STR or DEX)
- **DEX:** Rogue, Ranger, Monk -- 3 classes (Monk chooses STR or DEX)
- **INT:** Wizard, Artificer -- 2 classes
- **WIS:** Cleric, Druid -- 2 classes
- **CHA:** Bard, Thaumaturge -- 2 classes

Every mental stat has exactly two classes. STR and DEX are well-represented across the martial roster, with Monk straddling both. Monk's optional qi spells key off WIS, giving that stat secondary martial relevance.

## Ported Classes

All non-Artificer classes port directly from PF2e Remastered. Mechanical chassis, subclasses, and class feats are all ORC-licensed. Golarion-specific flavor text must be rewritten as original human-created content. Thaumaturge ports from Dark Archive Remastered (2026, ORC-licensed).

### Design Decisions by Class

Classes that port with zero changes: **Fighter, Barbarian, Druid, Champion, Ranger, Bard.** No design notes needed -- subclasses, feats, and features all work as-is.

**Rogue** -- Eldritch Trickster racket grants a free full caster multiclass dedication at level 1 (Wizard, Cleric, Druid, or Bard), gaining cantrips and eventual mana access through Basic Spellcasting (see [Dedications](15-dedications.md)).

**Monk** -- Qi spells are optional (Qi Spells feat, level 1). Player chooses divine or occult tradition; spellcasting attribute is WIS. Ports directly from Player Core 2.

**Wizard** -- Curriculum free casts: 1 free curriculum spell cast per day per spell rank you can access. At level 10 (max R5), this means 5 free curriculum casts (one each at R1-R5). Maps 1:1 to PF2e's bonus prepared curriculum spell per rank. See [Spellcasting](10-spellcasting.md#class-bonus-casts).

**Cleric** -- Healing Font / Harmful Font: WIS modifier (minimum 1) free Heal (or Harm) casts per day at any rank you can cast. These don't cost mana. At WIS +4, level 10: 4 free Heals at up to R5. Preserves the Cleric's healing identity as a resource separate from their general mana pool. See [Spellcasting](10-spellcasting.md#class-bonus-casts).

**Thaumaturge** -- No tradition in PF2e (no spellcasting). For our grid, we assign occult tradition to any focus spells gained through feats, matching the class's flavor and lineage. Ports from Dark Archive Remastered (2026, ORC-licensed).

## Artificer (New Design)

The only fully new class. Modeled on PF2e Alchemist's chassis -- defined by its infusion/preparation system, not by spellcasting. See [Artificer](06-artificer.md) for the complete design.

## Empowered Class Signature Mechanics

Each empowered class has a signature mechanic that defines its identity. No mana -- magic comes through class features and focus spells.

| Class | Tradition | Signature Mechanic | Resource |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Champion | Divine | Champion's Reaction + Lay on Hands | Reaction + focus points |
| Ranger | Primal | Hunt Prey + Hunter's Edge | Free (one action) + warden spells via feats |
| Artificer | Arcane | Tamper + subclass production (daily prep) | 1 action/round + daily prep slots + focus points |
| Thaumaturge | Occult | Exploit Vulnerability + Implements | 1 action/round + implement abilities |

## Expansion Candidates

Classes reserved for future expansion:

- **Psychic** -- CHA occult caster with conscious minds, amps, and Unleash Psyche. Powerful and mechanically distinct but complex. Strong expansion class for experienced players. Streamlining candidates: standardize amps, simplify Unleash Psyche crash.
- **Sorcerer** -- Overlaps with Wizard in arcane caster space. Bloodline mechanics are cool expansion content.
- **Witch** -- CHA occult caster with familiar. Familiar management complexity deferred; strong expansion class.
- **Magus** -- Arcane gish with Spellstrike. Strong expansion with established dedication template.
- **Swashbuckler** -- Stylish martial with panache. Overlaps with Rogue niche.
- **Inventor, Oracle, Summoner, Kineticist** -- All specialized, all expansion material.
