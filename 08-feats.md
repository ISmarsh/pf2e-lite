# Feats

## Overview

PF2e's four feat tracks (class, skill, general, ancestry) consolidated to **three tracks**. Reduces browsing complexity while preserving meaningful character customization.

## The Three Feat Tracks

### Class Feats — Every Even Level (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

5 total. Define your playstyle within your class. Unchanged from PF2e. This is where real character identity lives.

### General Feats (Merged Skill + General) — Every Odd Level Starting at 3 (3, 5, 7, 9)

4 total. Combined pool of PF2e's skill feats and general feats. More interesting choices at each level because you're choosing between "skill unlock or general improvement" rather than picking one of each from separate lists.

### Ancestry Feats — Levels 1, 5, 9

3 total. Ancestry-specific abilities. Unchanged from PF2e. First feat picked at level 1 is a good onboarding moment — "what's cool about being a dwarf?" is an easier question than browsing class feats.

## Advancement Table

| Level | Class Feat | General Feat | Ancestry Feat |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | — | — | ✓ |
| 2 | ✓ | — | — |
| 3 | — | ✓ | — |
| 4 | ✓ | — | — |
| 5 | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| 6 | ✓ | — | — |
| 7 | — | ✓ | — |
| 8 | ✓ | — | — |
| 9 | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| 10 | ✓ | — | — |

**Total: 5 class + 4 general + 3 ancestry = 12 feats** (down from PF2e's 15 across four tracks).

With Free Archetype as standard (see [Core Rules](01-core-rules.md)), characters also get archetype feats at every even level, partially compensating for the reduction.

## Skill Feats in the General Pool

PF2e's skill feats join the general feat pool as genuine choices. After evaluating all 16 skills for "must-take" feats (using RPGBot ratings and community consensus), only Medicine had feats that were effectively mandatory rather than build-dependent. Those two feats — Continual Recovery and Ward Medic — are folded into Medicine proficiency benefits instead of existing as feats (see [Skills](07-skills.md#proficiency-benefits)).

All remaining skill feats (Battle Medicine, Quick Repair, Swift Sneak, Intimidating Glare, Bon Mot, etc.) are genuine choices in the merged general pool.

### Why no other skills have mandatory feats

- **Crafting:** Quick Repair and specialty feats (Alchemical, Magical, Snare) are build-dependent. The Craft and Repair actions already scale by proficiency (more HP restored, higher-level items craftable).
- **Stealth:** Swift Sneak is Green-rated (nice, not essential). Sneaking at half Speed is a meaningful trade-off, not a trap.
- **Athletics:** Feats vary by fighting style — Titan Wrestler matters for grapplers, not swimmers.
- **Intimidation:** Intimidating Glare is useful but not essential — Demoralize works fine verbally.
- **Social / Knowledge / Thievery:** All feats are build-dependent or roleplay-dependent. No universal taxes.

## Feat Density Math

- PF2e levels 1–10: 5 skill feats + 2 general feats = 7 picks from those tracks, but 2–3 are mandatory (Medicine chain for any healer), leaving ~4–5 genuine choices
- Our system: 4 general feats from a merged pool, all genuine choices. Medicine's mandatory feats are proficiency benefits, not feat picks.
- Free Archetype (standard in our system, see [Core Rules](01-core-rules.md)) adds 5 archetype feats as a separate customization axis.
- Net: 4 genuine choices vs PF2e's ~4–5 genuine choices. The gap is 0–1 feat, offset by archetype flexibility.
