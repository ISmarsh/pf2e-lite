# Feats

## Overview

PF2e's four feat tracks (class, skill, general, ancestry) consolidated to **three chosen tracks** plus one automatic system. Reduces browsing complexity while preserving meaningful character customization.

## The Three Feat Tracks

### Class Feats — Every Even Level (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

5 total. Define your playstyle within your class. Unchanged from PF2e. This is where real character identity lives.

### General Feats (Merged Skill + General) — Every Odd Level Starting at 3 (3, 5, 7, 9)

4 total. Combined pool of PF2e's skill feats and general feats. More interesting choices at each level because you're choosing between "skill unlock or general improvement" rather than picking one of each from separate lists.

### Ancestry Feats — Levels 1, 5, 9

3 total. Ancestry-specific abilities. Unchanged from PF2e. First feat picked at level 1 is a good onboarding moment — "what's cool about being a dwarf?" is an easier question than browsing class feats.

## Advancement Table

| Level | Class Feat | General Feat | Ancestry Feat |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | — | — | ✓ |
| 2 | ✓ | — | — |
| 3 | — | ✓ | — |
| 4 | ✓ | — | — |
| 5 | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| 6 | ✓ | — | — |
| 7 | — | ✓ | — |
| 8 | ✓ | — | — |
| 9 | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| 10 | ✓ | — | — |

**Total: 5 class + 4 general + 3 ancestry = 12 feats** (down from PF2e's 17 across four tracks).

With Free Archetype as standard (see [Core Rules](01-core-rules.md)), characters also get archetype feats at every even level, partially compensating for the reduction.

## Proficiency Auto-Unlocks

When you reach a proficiency threshold in a skill, you automatically gain the feat that most players would take anyway. The "feat tax" becomes a reward for investment.

**Design test:** "Would an experienced PF2e player tell a new player they're making a mistake by *not* taking this feat?" If yes, it should auto-unlock.

### Likely Candidates (To Be Finalized)

**Medicine:**

- Trained: Battle Medicine
- Expert: Continual Recovery
- Master: Ward Medic

**Athletics:**

- Expert: Titan Wrestler or similar

**Intimidation:**

- Trained: Intimidating Glare

**Crafting:**

- Expert: Quick Repair + Field Crafting (see [Crafting](14-crafting.md))
- Master: Efficient Crafting

**Stealth:**

- Expert: Swift Sneak

Other skills have fewer "mandatory" feats, so their skill feats stay in the general pool as genuine choices.

## Feat Density Math

- PF2e across levels 1–10: 5 skill feats + 4 general feats = 9 picks from those tracks
- Our system: 4 general feats (merged pool) + ~3–6 automatic proficiency unlocks = 7–10 total
- Result: Similar feat density, higher average quality of choices, less time browsing for the "right" answer

## Open Design Work

- Complete list of auto-unlock feats per skill: deferred until classes are fully sketched
- Interaction between auto-unlocks and class features that already grant these feats (avoid double-granting)
- Balance review of Battle Medicine at Trained for all characters
